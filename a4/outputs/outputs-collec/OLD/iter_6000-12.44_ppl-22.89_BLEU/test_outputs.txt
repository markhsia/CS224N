You know that what I do is writing for children , and , in fact , I 'm probably the painting for children , more read in the United States .
And I always tell people that I do n't want it as a scientist .
And I can take it as a farmer , or with <unk> clothes , and they never have a farmer .
I 'm here to talk about circles , and you know .
And you know that a result is something that you get you in some place .
You just have to give it back to the apple to see it as a <unk> .
That 's the painting of a circle .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> .
It 's the kind of circle that I 'm going to talk about .
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school , in <unk> , Ohio where I was the weird one .
When you go back to a square week in the bathroom of the boys , until a teacher gave me life .
She gave me my life to put to the bathroom room .
He made it in secret .
For three years .
And I had to go from the city .
I had a doctor , and 60 dollars , and ended in San Francisco , California -- I found a reactor -- and in the late years , I felt the need to begin to work in organizations who are against AIDS .
A lot of three or four years ago , half of the night I got a phone call from that teacher , the <unk> Street said , `` I need to see it .
I 'm sure that you 've never got to know .
You could <unk> them , and please allow that man that you 've already found .
And I need to tell you that I have cancer cancer , and I 'd like to be able to get you with this please . ''
Well , the next day we were in Congo .
And we went to see , you know , we saw it , and we realized that she needed to be <unk> .
We found a place , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and it was necessary , and it was necessary .
It 's something we know how to do .
And so as the woman I wanted to think about as a adult came on , became a box box and it was put in my hands .
And what happened was that the circle was closed , he had become a circle -- and that 's the ones that I talked about it was done in themselves .
The thing is that death is part of life .
She gave me my life , my partner and I 'll give you the one of her .
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life .
It 's true and beauty , and I 'm very happy that I talked about a lot of this .
They also needs -- very dignity , love and pleasure , and it 's our work to show those things .
Thank you .
As a artist , the connection is very important for me .
Through my work , I 'm trying to express that humans are not aware of the nature , and that everything is available .
I went for the first time in Antarctica , almost 10 years ago , and there I saw my first <unk> .
I was born .
My heart , I was <unk> , trying to understand what I was in front of me .
The <unk> to my own <unk> , almost 60 meters , and I could n't find it to think that it was from an snow of snow over another per snow per year after year .
They 're born when you 're going to come out of the roots or the <unk> inequality .
They have their own healthy personality .
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences .
Some of you to give you to the end of the end , while others can not put up , and it 's <unk> in a <unk> of passion .
It 's easy to think about , when you see a hammer , they are isolated from <unk> and themselves , in great as we see us as humans .
But the reality is all the opposite .
And as it 's a <unk> , I 'm going to get your atmosphere .
So , as it 's a <unk> , it takes a rich water , rich water in minerals that came into a lot of life .
I 'm going to photograph these <unk> as if he was a <unk> of my ancestors , knowing that in these only moments of the only moment of that way , and they do n't get it in the way again .
It 's not the death when you go up ; it 's not a end , but it 's not a end , but one of their road for the life of life .
There 's a part of the ice that I 'm very young -- has a couple of thousands of years .
And another part of the ice has over 100 thousand years .
The last pictures I 'd like to show you , they are from a <unk> that I was born in <unk> , Greenland .
It 's a little bit of us to be able to be able to look at a <unk> .
Here you have .
You can see the left a little boat .
It 's about five meters .
And I would like to get attention to the way of the conservation and its line of <unk> .
You can see here , he begins to get the boat , the boat has gone into the other hand and the man is there .
This is a <unk> of <unk> , from average size .
<unk> of the water about five feet or 40 meters .
This video is in real time .
And so you know , the <unk> shows a different side of their personality .
Thank you .
I want you to imagine , you imagine two , the same day , the same day , the same day , every single <unk> .
So , two <unk> each of a baby .
I do n't want you to get it up too much in the details of the community , because if you get to thinking about to think about it in yes , you do n't get attention .
I think about that for a moment .
And in this stage , I want you to imagine that , in a case , in a case , in a case , the <unk> and the mountains are taken to the sea layer .
And , in the other case , the mountains of the mountains are taken up to the mountains of the shadow .
They were able to get it , and it starts life .
Let 's talk about them .
In my brain activity , they get two penguins .
In one of my penguins , work with the story of anatomy .
I 'm able to measure , and what we study in this case is the way that people know the anatomy is the way that people know , of humans and <unk> , how they 've got to lose the body , the idea of the body ; what have thought about the body .
And the other role that performance in my work is the activist , as a half of patients or , as I 'm saying to sometimes , we 're able to try to get out of people who are patients .
In this case , I 've been working with people because of the physical features of the social rules .
I 've been working , for example , with <unk> <unk> , two people in a same body .
I 've worked with people with <unk> , people a lot more than the average .
And I 've been working with a lot of people with sex sex , individuals who does n't get it in the black and local farmers .
In the lines , we can call it <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to put you some examples of ways to have a sex , which is not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in the large ways or the <unk> .
For example , it 's the case of the individual in the base of the foundation of the 1970s , and he says to the <unk> , we all have in life , that we all have in life .
And then , in life life , the <unk> produce .
But because this is that this kind of <unk> , the body does n't look at the same .
It 's the <unk> syndrome .
So , there 's a high levels but no reaction .
As a consequence , the body would be able to make a <unk> course .
When you know , the baby has a child .
It 's a child . It 's like a child .
And often , it 's not , it 's not , it 's not , but it 's going to grow and developing the environment , but it does n't have the time , but when someone would realize that something is happening .
And then we were able to be able to realize that in time , in time , in time to have <unk> , and the reality has been broken , and the reality has been involved .
The important thing to understand is that you can think that 's about a man , but actually not it .
Women , as the men , we have in the body , something is in the body .
They are in the top of the body .
Now , the <unk> Goals produce <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> .
The majority of women like I 'm going to tell you a typical woman ; it does n't know their structure , I think it 's a typical woman , I think it 's a typical woman for the women as I do it .
We 'll be able to be able to be able to do it , and let 's take the <unk> .
As a consequence , someone like I have the most <unk> brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with Iran who has the <unk> syndrome .
So the sex is something complicated . It 's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- in some way you can be everywhere .
Another example : a few years ago , a few years ago I got a call a call from a child , born and written as a child -- I was born , and sex , and sex with her , he was a life as a kid , and I 'd just had to discover that I was called and they 'd just find it .
I had a <unk> way as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I had in rural culture , and in the top of the <unk> , they were so similar that , in essence , made a <unk> environment .
As a result , their ears were <unk> , their brain was exposed to the component of a sound .
He was born with a child , nobody does nothing .
And it was going to go to the 19 years when I started to have trouble problems , because the doctors found that , in fact , in fact , it was woman .
Well , another example of a <unk> case of <unk> .
Some people with <unk> in the world develop what you know like <unk> , is , they have <unk> system in <unk> system .
We do n't know why happens .
So , there 's a lot of sex .
The reason for the reason that children with this kind of bodies , we 're going to get it up , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> in order to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
In many of a lot of people are completely healthy .
The reason why you go to a few places is that they are a threat for our social categories .
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy of a particular particular particular identity .
We have the idea that being woman is to have a female identity , they were , and it 's going to be black , you want to say to have Yemen .
And a idea that 's a nervous idea .
And when you get us a body that shows something pretty different , we have problems with <unk> .
So , we have very much ideas in our culture , it 's going to use it .
Our nation is based in a concept of the very romantic .
Imagine the amazing thing that 's having children who were born as two people in a same body .
Now , the most <unk> case is the past last year in the past <unk> <unk> <unk> ; they put it in the middle of this their sex in the United States <unk> .
A lot of <unk> <unk> to ask me , `` What do you go to do to determine if <unk> <unk> is man or woman ? ''
And I had to explain the robots that does n't exist .
In fact , we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to argue that nature is not going to argue that nature 's not called the <unk> line between men and women or women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and
So , what we have is a situation where the more changing the science , we have to argue that these categories , we 've been able to argue that these categories of these categories that we thought were based directly with more <unk> categories .
And not only in terms of sex .
And also in terms of death , something that it turns out a lot more complicated from what the weather allows it .
And as you see , we 'll get it in a <unk> terrain .
Now , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimpanzees .
What did the fact of the fact of them in only a few years ?
And as we look at the science , we 've got every time more in a strong area in which we have to recognize that the categories that are probably too exciting .
And we 're looking at this in all of the human life .
One of them , for example , in our current culture , in the United States today , they are the ability to the beginning and the end of life .
It 's hard to make a moment from which a body needs human , and have different rights to the <unk> .
There 's very <unk> today in the day , but I know inside the <unk> , but I know in the <unk> of the <unk> when someone are dead .
Our ancestors would never have to get up with this question of if somebody was dead .
As a lot of a lot of the nose in front of the nose , and if it was still not the <unk> .
If I went to move the <unk> .
But today we can , for example , to take a <unk> system of a body and put in another body .
And as a consequence , we need to come up to the point of determine to determine the death of someone , and this tells us in a hard situation where we do n't have the simple categories of the past .
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories could be able to make someone like me .
In politics , I 'm a <unk> , we talked to people with the bodies , but I have to argue that I was nervous .
<unk> that these categories are a lot more <unk> from what we thought .
<unk> from the point of view of democracy .
And to tell you about this room , I first have to tell you that I 'm a <unk> , I 'm going to tell you that I 'm a headline from the Germans .
Yes , they were born , I know that were <unk> , but they were big .
I want to say , they were so rich and <unk> , and so we do that , that I find each other looking at that music , '' and not for the music , which is completely <unk> .
It 's why he happened in the meantime with the Germans .
They were born , for me , the first activists of the anatomy and I explain why .
What they had been a concept , and the <unk> with another that it was beautiful and beautiful and became for 200 years .
And as you all remember , what we 've been able to come up , it was the idea of the Congo , the Grand has been the idea of the river . The Congo was born in a very objective concept .
The single world of the old world do n't know DNA , but they had really clear the idea of a day .
They had the concept of blood blood .
They were from the idea that 's going to be able to be the political power for the <unk> of the grandfather to the father , and then the son , etc .
And they 're going to tell you that idea , and it 's a new concept for a new concept , and that concept was that all men are created the same .
They get the field of play , and decided that the anatomy that comes up was the anatomy in common and not the intellectual differences . That was something very radical .
And in part of what they were doing because there 's a part of a system in which they were given two things .
It was a democracy and at the same time in the same time .
And it 's very clear , if you look at the story of the Germans , which many were very interested in science and in the idea of a world .
They were <unk> from the <unk> , and therefore , the concept of power power comes out of a <unk> idea of birth .
They were moving into a concept .
And if we look at , for example , the economists of the course , talking about nature and the god of nature .
They do n't talk about God and the nature of God .
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
And in fact , they were going to get the idea of the efficacy .
And it 's going to do it , they were the edge of the future movement .
You do n't think about that way , but they did it , and it was great .
And what happened later ?
And women were born .
And then he came to the success of the Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> , who said , `` I 'm not a woman ? ''
We found men in the <unk> movement saying , `` I 'm a man . ''
So again , people from color , and people who would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it out about the successful difference , and again .
We see the same with the <unk> of <unk> .
The problem is , of course , that as we look at the robots , we have to start to ask what you take certain of us .
But , it 's attention , I want to keep you a little bit on a gentleman in our culture .
For example , I do n't want to give a fish , the same rights than a human .
I do n't want to tell you that we should be able to do with the anatomy .
I do n't want to tell the children of five years , they had to try to have sex sex or get them .
There 's a lot of truths that for me have sense , and I think we should keep them .
But the challenge is to try to discover what they are , why do you have sense .
Well , let 's go to those two people at the beginning of this talk .
We have two people , both <unk> in the top of the exactly the same day .
So let 's imagine that one of them , Mary was born three months before , the one of time .
Richard , by the opposite , was born in term : I was born the one of <unk> .
At the only fact , I 've been born three months earlier that Mary came up all of the rights three months before there is the right <unk> , the right to the <unk> , the right to <unk> .
Richard has to wait for everything , because it 's not because it 's an biological age , but because he was born after .
We found other in relationship to their rights .
Richard , at the <unk> of being considered man , `` I do n't tell you if it 's <unk> , in virtue of being considered man -- is now <unk> the <unk> <unk> , but it does n't have to worry .
Man , for her part , it does n't have the same rights to the marriage that sitting in all the states , for example .
Here you can go in all the states with a woman , but Mary can put up with a woman just in some states .
So , we still make it , we 're still going to ask them in a few ways that in a few ways they have to have to do and try .
And now the question is : What do we do now that the science is going to be so much in the field of the anatomy that we 've got to the point of having to the point of having to be able to be able to do that a democracy based on the anatomy could n't happen ?
I do n't want to give the science , but at the same time sometimes I feel like that the science would get us .
Do we go ?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a sort of attitude , `` Well , we have to get the line in some part , so we 're going to do . ''
But a lot of people are born in a position position .
For example , Texas in a moment , I decided to get up with a man , there 's no one , and that to give you with a woman , there is that I 've got in a woman , and that to give you with a woman .
Now , in the practice , you do n't do sure , they do n't make people .
But this is also very strange to the story that I told to the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk> .
If you look at one of the modern parents of democracy , Dr. Martin Luther Luther , in your God , `` I 'm going to go back . ''
He says that we should get to people , `` Do n't look at the color of their skin , but in the content of their character , '' then beyond the anatomy .
And I mean , `` Yes , the idea seems very good . ''
But in practice , how does it ?
How do you look at people in the basis of their character ?
I mean , I mean , I 'm not sure that I 'm not sure that we should be able to do in this for the support of the people , because I 've been able to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> , which you probably know about some other <unk> services that I know .
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> I know , you can take more decisions , smart , smart , and it 's going to go on their sex relationships that people .
So , how do you put in practice the topic of character ?
It turns very hard .
And one part of me , what happens if the character of a person could be able to be through a instrument with a instrument , maybe with a <unk> .
We want to get that point ?
I 'm not sure about where we go .
What I know it is that it seems to be very important to be very important than the United States , you 'll see this very important thing to think of democracy .
We 've done a good job in a democracy , and I think we 'll make a good job in the future .
We do n't live , for example , in a context as the <unk> in which one man who feels only by other men , less than it 's willing to be killed , less than it 's willing to be a change change .
We are not in that situation .
I feel that we do n't have a context like the one of a surgeon , with which I talked about a couple of years ago , which was actually going to give light to light to light , and so they get their fame .
But when the phone asked the reason of the event was a very <unk> operation , I said that in that other country , these children would be very excited , and so I had to do it .
And what I said , `` Well , it has been considered the political tree in the <unk> , right ? ''
The one of the United States , a huge possibilities to people to be who they are in <unk> who are without <unk> by the top of the state .
So I think we have to be the head .
Well , to end , to end , I want to tell you that I 've been talking about a lot of them .
And I want to think about how it would be democracy , or as it could have been , if we had to be , if we were able to be able to be able to be able to get the <unk> .
And I want to tell you something a little bit of a <unk> , and it 's that I think you can have different ideas from different democracies , in particular if there are people thinking about a group .
From a few years ago , I thought I 've been interested in the <unk> , I 've also been interested in the <unk> performance .
And one of the things that has been interested on are the differences between men and women in the way to think , and they needed in the world .
And what we know about the <unk> studies is that women , in average , not all , but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to social relationships and to try from those who are <unk> in the group .
And if we think about that , we have a interesting situation in our hands .
A few years ago , when I was in the graduate , one of my uncle who knew that I was interested in the fact , I knew that I was interested in the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> me made it .
`` Tell me what it 's going to teach you . ''
And I thought , `` It 's the most sure question I 've heard .
You have to see with the <unk> of gender , so there 's not nothing of the <unk> of gender , so there 's not anything . ''
But the more I 've thought in your question , more , you 've got to be like that there 's something that 's something .
It 's saying , that could have something , in average , something different between the <unk> brain and the sound that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and try to help the more vulnerable .
So , if well , if you were very able to find the way to protect people through the state of the state , it 's possible that , that we 've got to go back to this concept , maybe we would have the concept of protection with the support support .
And maybe that 's what we 've got to do in the future when they 've got the most beyond democracy beyond the anatomy : think less in the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more in relationships .
So as we try to create a more perfect thing , think about what we do about the other .
Thank you .
In the year 2007 , I decided we had to perceive how we think about economic development .
Our new goal should be that when each other people do where it wants to go to live and work , they have the possibility to choose between the less a bunch of different cities that they 're used to attract new communities .
Well , in this moment we are far from that goal .
There 's thousands of millions of people in developing countries who do n't tell you with a single city to <unk> .
But the amazing thing of cities is that they 're going to make a lot more than their cost cost .
So we could be able to be able to put the world , maybe hundreds of new cities .
Well , this can you sound absurd if you 've never thought about new cities .
But just <unk> by buildings .
Imagine that half of the ones I wanted to live in the planes , they were , and then in the other half it 's still going to do it .
We could try to increase the ability to make it available in all the buildings .
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that these buildings , and the areas that they have to get the rules , and the areas that they have rules to prevent the building and the <unk> .
So , it would be very hard to do all of those .
But you could go to a very new place , we build a completely new building building , always , and when the rules of that place <unk> the building in time .
So I understood that the governments would have new pieces of big intelligence , so we gave cities , and I gave them a name : cities under the <unk> .
I learned that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> , they were thinking about the challenge .
You know , every year about 75 <unk> <unk> from his country to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask what they could do to tell you that those people could be able to do and do those same things in Senegal .
In the summer of 2009 , in the summer of 2009 in a <unk> crisis .
In the next choice , you 'll get it up to <unk> with a platform in which they celebrate researchers and the same time .
He asked to <unk> that it 's his boss .
While I was going to give you to give a talk to give you a talk at chaos .
Through a process of familiar , trial , and a big amount of evidence with users , trying to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential ideas .
The first point was the importance of the rules , as the rules that they say that you can not go to , and they 're able to get all the whole world .
You 'll have a lot of attention to the new technologies , but they need to need to be so much of technologies as much of technologies as well , and usually are the rules that allow us to move .
In the last end of 2010 , a friend of God sent to <unk> a <unk> with the quote .
I showed it to <unk> .
They called me .
They said , `` You know this to the leaders of our country . ''
So , in December , we came back in Cambridge , in a hotel room .
I tried to explain this point about what we are cities , much more than their cost cost .
And I used this image that shows the value of the river in a place like New York City .
But it was a little discussion , and in some time , when there was a <unk> , <unk> said , `` Paul , maybe we could see the video of the TED talk . ''
And the talk I was born in a very simple terms that a city in a single city , it 's a place where it begins with <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that tells the rules that you can choose if you want to go or do n't live in those rules .
So the president of course I was called , and he said we had to do this project , this is important , this might be the road to be doing it .
He asked me that it was going to <unk> , and I talk about the four and five of January .
So I took another talk about data , which has a picture like this , which was a picture like this , that I 'm trying to explain to <unk> a lot of value to a city , this has to be very big .
This is a picture of IDEO , and the white line is the new airport that was built on .
There 's only this three day over 100 miles .
So , I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a site that 's going to start with the less one of a half miles .
That 's more than 100 hectares .
All the world 's <unk> .
They were a lot of the public , they were very easy and listen .
The leader leader came up to the platform , and he said , `` You know , I 'm a lot of , so much for their talk , but maybe we could see the video of the talk of the talk .
I have here in my computer . ''
So I felt , and he showed it the quote .
And this brings out the essential ; that a new city can make new choices for people .
We have a choice of a city that you could go to be in before , instead of hundreds of miles to the North .
And also a new choices for leaders .
Because the leaders of the government 's government are going to be able to be able to control the countries that they could help you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to try and make the rules of it ,
We were , and we saw a website .
This picture is there .
You could take it .
And a little later , the 17th of January , they were born in Congress for <unk> their Constitution and we find it a conversation that could be able to create these special regions of development .
In a country that I had to go through this dominant crisis , the Taliban in Congress to give you from this pencil , it was from <unk> to one .
Everybody , all of them , all of them in society , the <unk> .
To <unk> in the Constitution , you have to spend two times in Congress .
The 17 of February became over another time in the top of a limited .
He brought back after the Taliban , in the 21 to 24 of February , a number of a few <unk> , it was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participate in building cities .
One of them is South Korea .
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in South Korea ; it 's more big than the Boston center .
All of what you see there was built in four years ago , after it came from four years ago .
The other country in building cities is Singapore .
In fact , we 've built two cities in China , and they 're preparing for a third .
And if you think about this way , this is the point where we are .
They have a website , and you 're already thinking about a website for the second city .
They 're going to give you a legal system that would be able to come up , and then we could have been able to be able to have in a <unk> system .
A country has been prepared to prevent her police , and it 's the end of the last thing for this new system .
There 's open , and where they 're very interested in the project .
You can even get a little bit .
But the only thing we know that you 've already seen is that they have a good number of people .
There 's a lot of companies that would want to go in the United States , especially in a place with a <unk> area , and there 's a lot of people who would like to go to live there .
In the world , there are seven billion people who say that I would like to be able to go back to the last place .
There 's a million at the year that comes from American America to go to the United States .
Many of them are parents who have to leave her family to go to get a work ; sometimes they are local mothers who have to make the money for so eat or buy clothes or buy clothes .
Unfortunately , sometimes there are even children who are trying to share with their parents who have n't seen , in some cases , in a decade .
So , what does you think about the building of a new city in Senegal ?
Or build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these all the world ?
What does you think about where the families can choose between several cities that are going to choose to bring new cities ?
This is a idea that 's going to spread it .
And my friends <unk> told me , `` Thank you TED . ''
I 'm <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
But before you would show you what there is inside , I 'm going to make a public box , and it 's that , alive with the <unk> .
I love to find , let me find it , and more recently , photograph , and he looked at me in my blog blog , etc. and different for every day .
But I do n't read anything new .
All my clothes is a second hand from <unk> and shops of second hand .
Ah , thank you .
The second number of second hand allowed me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my stomach .
I 'm going to know people <unk> , by the large of my money is going to be a good cause ; my future is only , and buy it becomes a personal search search .
So , what I 'm going to find today ?
Do you be from my body ?
?
Do you get less than 20 dollars ?
If all of the answers are positive , then I feel that I 've won .
When I 'm looking at the subject of my <unk> , I want to tell you what it 's going to do for this exciting week in TED .
I mean , what does you do somebody who has all all that clothes ?
So I 'm going to show you exactly what I did .
I 've got these seven pairs of clothes inside , and nothing else .
He turned up to exactly a week is everything I 've got in my <unk> .
I realized that it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use to use after you get here .
And you know , I do n't know like the woman who 's going to go for TED , that means that I found some things .
And I 'd like to show you now the <unk> for this week .
Do n't be interesting ?
While I do , I 'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life , which is , or not , I 've learned in this adventure of not use clothes .
Let 's start with the shoulder .
Now , this is a brilliant button .
You do n't have to spend a lot of money to see well .
You always always see you for less than 50 dollars .
All of the set , including the guy , and it 's the more expensive thing I 've used in the week .
See , the color is energy .
It 's almost <unk> , impossible to be a impossible system , when you 're a lot of a very brilliant .
If you 're happy , you 're going to help each other people .
He said , `` The recession is <unk> .
I 've spent a lot of time in life trying to be , and the same time <unk> .
I just know you .
If you give you from the right people , not only you , you also get it .
<unk> : <unk> the child you 're going on .
Sometimes people would tell me that it seems to play , or I remember their little few years ago .
I like <unk> and tell you , `` Thank you . ''
Man : This is the key thing .
If you think you look at you with something , it 's almost sure you are .
And if you think you do n't see you with something , probably also be true .
My mother taught me this day after day .
But it was n't to 30 years I really understood their meaning .
And I 'm going to explain it in a few seconds .
If you think you are a beautiful person in your inside and outside , you do n't see you .
So there 's no excuse for one of this audience .
We should be able to do everything we want to do .
Thank you .
<unk> : A real real truth six words for you : The <unk> <unk> are with everything .
And finally , he turned up , it 's a good way to tell the world , and it 's a great way to tell the world something about you do n't have to say a word .
I 've got one and another time when people came up to me this week , just for what I was using it , and we had great conversations .
All of this is not going to go in my little <unk> .
So before I went back to home , in Brooklyn , I 'm going to celebrate everything .
Because the lesson that I 'm trying to learn this week is that there 's going to leave a certain things .
I do n't need to make these things like these things , because of the back back in the corner , there 's always another fun .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
This is a number of your brain that we can see in two parts .
The left side , which is the part of logic , and the right side , which is the magic part .
So , if you get a scale to measure the <unk> of every century , we could design a <unk> of our brain .
For example , this would be somebody who 's completely familiar .
This would be a question that 's completely familiar .
So , Where are the brain in this scale ?
Some <unk> for one of these end , but I think that for most of the middle of this audience , its brain is something like -- with a big <unk> in the same time .
It 's not to be each other .
You can be familiar and subtle .
I show you one of those people , which as most of the other physical physicists , we need a lot of logic , we need a lot of logic for <unk> these hard ideas .
But at the same time , we need very intuition to do that experiments actually work .
How do we build this intuition ? Well , we like to play with things .
We put it to play with them , and then we see it as we can see it , and then we developed our intuition from that point .
And actually , you do the same thing .
It 's a challenge that you can have developed with the step of the years , is the which says that one thing can be only in a place .
It 's going to say , it may be amazing to think that one thing is in two different places in the same time , but you do n't go up with this notion , the communities .
I remember a child playing in a parking camera .
It was a little child , and they did n't get it very well .
But I noticed that the play with that camera , and it 's that the big things do n't allow the <unk> , and it 's going to get in a place .
This is a big model that can be able to have the world , except that you get a physical physical .
It would be a terrible model for a terrible model for a physical physical , because they do n't play with a lot of a lot , play with these little particles .
And when you play with their particles , we realized that they do all sorts of things -- like that you can go on walls , or you can be in two places in the same time .
And then they put all these <unk> , and the theory of quantum mechanics of quantum mechanics .
And in that point , I found the physics of some years ago , they would have from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles .
But they do n't have the robots to describe the big objects that we get all the day .
That 's not very well to my intuition , and maybe it 's because it 's not because they do n't play .
Well , sometimes a game with them , but not a lot .
And I 've never seen .
It 's going to say , never nobody saw a language .
But it 's not going to take it back to my part logic .
Because if it 's all about small particles , and all the little particles have all the principles of the quantum mechanics , then we should n't have all the principles of quantum mechanics ?
I do n't find the reason why they should n't .
And so I 'm going to have a lot better if I could have a show that a common object is also going to get the principles of quantum mechanics .
It 's why a few years ago , I loved to do exactly that .
And I did .
This is the first object you can see that has been in a kind of quantum mechanics .
What you see here is a small chip .
And you can try to see the green point on the middle .
That 's the little bit of <unk> I 'm going to talk about a minute .
This is a picture of the object .
And here I 'm going to take a little bit . It 's even at the center .
And then here we do a good way to the small <unk> <unk> .
What you see it is a little bit of metal , with a way , and it 's a way to take it in a platform .
And then I did this almost the same way you would have a chip chip .
I went to a <unk> room with a chip chip , and then I put all the big machines for about 100 hours .
To the last material , I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> with a <unk> way of <unk> that you find under the device .
This device has to be the ability to be in a mechanics , but for it needs from a little help .
Let me do a analogy .
You know what it 's going to be in a full of people .
It 's saying , when I 'm in a way , I do all sorts of things , but then when another other people go back to do those things , because I do n't want to sleep , or , in fact , they do n't .
The quantum mechanics says that the <unk> objects are going on the same way .
Now , they gave them from the journey of social objects are not only people , it 's also the light that we 've got and the wind that happens to her side and the heat of the room .
And so we knew that if we wanted to do this little bit of <unk> to the quantum mechanics , we would have to reach all the other messages .
And that was what we did .
You 'll get the lights , then we would find it out of the lights , and then we put it all the air , and then they put it up to a number of less than a degree of a degree for the zero .
Now , to be just in the way , the little piece of metal is free to act as well .
So we measure their movements .
We found that in ways very few ways .
In place , in place , I was eliminated , and the way that <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a measure that moves up and it 's like .
And when you give them a <unk> , we could do that <unk> , and they do n't get it to the same time -- something that is only happening with quantum mechanics .
So what I 'm telling you is something really cool .
What does it mean , and it does n't go to the same time ?
Let 's think about the atoms .
In a case , all of the most atoms that you 've got that piece of <unk> , and the same time that they 're moving to the top and for the bottom .
It 's just in certain of them when those came up .
In the rest of the time are <unk> .
It wants to say that each other is in two different places at the same time , what it means that it means that all the piece of metal is in two different places .
I think this is great .
It 's true .
I 'm going to be <unk> in a <unk> room to do this for all of those years , because , look at this , the difference in scale between a one , and that 's a little bit of metal is more or less the same thing that 's kind of metal and you .
So if you just take it to be in two places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why do n't you do it ?
I mean , it 's my part of logic who speaks .
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time , how do it be that ?
How do you get your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space ?
There 's another part of the story .
And it 's when we take it , and we put the lights , and we looked at the lights and look at the box , we saw that the <unk> was left there in a piece .
And I could come to this new intuition , because of the objects in the fact , actually are only the individual objects that are just a lot in a small space .
You 'll talk about a lot about that the quantum mechanics , which is everything that everything is changed .
Well , that 's not so true .
It 's more than that , it 's more deep .
It 's that those connections , your connections to all the things that you get up , literally where you are . And that 's the deep one of quantum mechanics .
Thank you .
My name is <unk> .
And a 18 months ago , there 's another work in Google , until I looked at the idea of doing something that we do something like , and art to my mom who is here and they allowed to take them to make it .
He took me 18 months .
A lot of life and stories , you know , with 17 ways of nine countries .
But I 'm going to be going to go to you in the interest .
There 's a lot of stories why we did .
I think , I think my own story is only just in this slide , and this is the access .
I grew up in India .
<unk> of a big education , I 'm not going to be <unk> , but I did n't have access to a lot of these senses and art .
And so , when I started to travel and go to millennia , I started able to learn a lot .
And working in Google , I try to make the desire to do it more accessible for technology .
So we have a team , a big team of people , and we started doing it .
You 'll go to show you a couple of things that we 've got a couple of things that we 've taken from from their own .
So , just , we go to <unk> .
Look around all the countries that there are .
It 's the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
So I 'm going to go in one of my favorites , the <unk> , the museum of art in New York .
There 's two ways to do it -- very simple .
We do it , and <unk> ! We 're now in the museum .
No matter where they are , Indonesia or <unk> , that does n't matter .
You 're moving by there , and they are these .
Do you want to fly for the museum ?
It 's the top of the top , and , with a one , and with a one , we put inside .
They 're inside , you want to go at the end of the morning .
They 're going to go back .
<unk> .
Thank you , but I do n't get the best .
Now I 'm sitting in one of my favorite paintings , `` The <unk> . ''
I see the <unk> sign .
If the museum shows us the image , we do see there .
Look , this is one of the images .
Here 's all the information information .
To those of you who are really interested in art , you can do there , but I 'm going to do there , but I 'm going to do here .
And this is one of the images that we 've launched in what we call technology .
So this image , for example , it 's already , I think , about about 10,000 billion .
And there 's a lot of people who told me , `` And what you get about 10,000 billion ? ''
So I 'm going to show you what you 're going to get about 10,000 billion .
It may be able to do around a very simple way .
You see things fun .
I love this guy , their expression does n't have price .
But if I really want to connect .
So I started playing , and I found with something that happens there .
And I said , `` A moment , this seems interesting . ''
And I found that children were actually playing something .
I talked about a little , I talked about a few people from the <unk> , and actually I found that this is a game called a <unk> game , which is in a <unk> .
And it was very popular .
I do n't know why they did , but I 've learned something about it .
And now we 're going to get even more in the depth , and you 'll see you can be even going to get them to each other .
Now , just to give you a little bit of perspective , I 'm going to take the image , so you 'll see the image , so you 'll see what there is .
This is where we were , and this is the painting .
The best is going to come , a second .
So now we 're going to jump to jump again in New York .
Here 's another of my favorites , `` The night <unk> . ''
The example I showed was to find details .
But what if you know if you do , you know ?
And if you want to see how you 're going to see how you 're going to do this work ?
It 's going to get it , and I 'm true .
I 'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture , and I actually 'm going to go to transport .
This is `` <unk> <unk> , '' I think I 've never seen so before .
I 'm going to show you another of my favorite technology .
There 's a lot of things more here , but I do n't have time .
This is the really cool part . It 's called `` <unk> . ''
All of you , absolutely all of us , not matter if it 's rich or poor , or if you have a proposal , that day .
You can actually create their own museum , create their own collection of all these images .
It 's very simple , we went , I 've created this function that I call `` The power power '' -- we 're going to do a place around .
It 's about `` <unk> '' in the National Museum of London .
You can ask things , let me go back to their friends and keep a conversation about what they feel like to figure out these works .
So in conclusion , I think for me , the main thing is that all of the amazing things actually come from one of Google .
No , in my mind , even they 're not going to come from the Himalayas .
Maybe I should n't say this .
Actually , they come from those artists .
And that has been my own experience with this .
I mean , I hope to say , I hope that in this digital digital , you do justice to their art work , and that it 's the <unk> behavior .
And the great question that I do today in day is , `` You did this to make the experience of go to a museum ? ''
And the answer is not .
It 's to rebuild the experience .
And that 's everything . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I have something to show you .
Now , think that 's a <unk> , a <unk> .
In our lab , we call it design design .
I 'm going to tell you a little bit about this .
If you look at this picture -- I 'm from Cambridge , all the children in Italy , with this picture in the wall of their bedroom , but the reason I 'm going to show you this is that has happened very interesting in the <unk> of the last one in the last two decades .
A few time , if you wanted to give you a career career , I 'll get a budget , and the <unk> to a good seat , and a good car .
And if the car and the line were good enough , you get the career .
This is what , in engineering , it 's <unk> system system system .
It 's basically a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
Today , what 's interesting is that the lack of control in real time are starting to go in our lives .
Our cities , in the last years , they have been from networks and electronics .
They 're going to go back to the air .
And as well , you 're starting to answer a different way , and you can be able to get up and <unk> .
<unk> cities is something big .
As a note , I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but 50 percent of the global population .
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and until 80 percent of the CO2 emissions .
If we could do something with cities , it would be a big thing .
More there of cities , all of these men , and they 're going into our objects .
This is from a exhibition of <unk> <unk> for a year in the east , during the summer .
It 's called `` You show me . ''
Well , our objects , the environment , they start to hear .
In the way , it 's like a almost all of the atoms that they have to get sensors and put them .
And that 's changing all the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment .
In a sense of sense is almost like in the old dream of scratch .
Now , you know , when you go back to the <unk> , you say that at the end I took the hammer , and they put it back to the fact , you actually actually see a little <unk> , and he said , `` You know , `` How do n't talk ? ''
Well , today , for the first time , our environment begins to him .
And I 'm going to show you just a few examples ; I 've invented in the idea of changing the environment , and it does something .
Let 's start with space .
The first project I wanted to share with you , is actually one of the first projects of our lab .
This was a half years ago and a half in Italy .
It was a summer .
It was the year that Italy gave the World Bank .
Maybe some of you remember , they put Italy and France , and at the end of <unk> gave the <unk> .
And of all , at the end he won Italy .
Now let 's see what happened looking at the activity of the network in the network .
Here we see the city .
You look at the middle in the middle and the river <unk> .
It 's the morning , before the game .
The line of time is in the top .
At the late later , there are people on here , and there 's doing called it .
It 's a game : silence .
<unk> from France .
<unk> , people do a quick call , and it 's the bathroom .
Second time .
A few time later , second .
<unk> , and in a moment , the <unk> .
Two Italy , yes !
That night came to the center .
There you see the great summit .
The next day they were at the middle of the Nobel team and the first minister of then .
And then all the world came up .
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where , from the <unk> , people go to celebrate ; it 's a great party , you can see the bottom at the end of the day .
This is just a example of how today you can measure the life of the city in a way that we do n't have been able to do just a few years ago .
Another example of Indonesia , it 's not about people , but of things we use and we create .
Today we know everything about our objects .
This is a map that shows all the chips that you do , you have a signal , how you get up .
But we know very little about where the things are .
So in this project , we developed a little bit of a little bit of a little bit to be able to be able to reduce the <unk> in their own system .
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year , to tell you what they were going to go , different kinds of things , as you can see , things that 's all about <unk> .
And then we put them a little chip , one of the <unk> , and then we started <unk> .
These are the results .
In Seattle .
after a week .
With this information , we realized that there 's a lot in the system .
We can do the same with a lot less energy .
These are data who did n't exist .
They 're going on things , and there 's a lot of food .
But the other thing that we think is that if you see all the days that the cup that 's going to get it , which is still in a place of the planet .
And if you could get a plastic than a day , there 's still there .
And if you show that to people , then we can make some change change .
That was the reason of the project .
My colleague of MIT , <unk> <unk> , it could tell us a lot more about space and many other things we can do with that , but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at the beginning , which is where it 's on the environment .
And the first project is something we did a couple of years in <unk> .
Everything started with a question of the mayor of the city , which came up and said that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water in public spaces , in the architecture .
And the question was , how can technology , the new technology , you do that ?
And one of the ideas that we developed in MIT , in a garage , it was : imagine that you have a <unk> and attack , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that you get up and get it .
It creates as a <unk> of water , with <unk> .
If you look at the surgeon , you can show patterns , images patterns , images , images .
And as you go to you , the surgeon would open to be , as you see in the image .
We built this to the <unk> mayor .
I 'd like a lot .
And it 's <unk> a gun to design the building to the <unk> .
And we call it out of a <unk> .
All the building is done from water .
There 's no doors or windows , but when you get it up , but when you get it out of it , and when you can come up .
The ceiling is also covered from water .
And if there 's a bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , it 's low the ceiling .
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears , like in this case .
Those days always have somebody , in the winter , when you go to the ceiling , somebody who was there , and he said , `` The <unk> . ''
No , it 's not , you know , it 's not that you 've got to say , but that when you 're low all of the architecture .
Here 's the way .
You see the <unk> people for what happens inside .
And here I 'm the same trying to do the sensors that open the water .
I think that I should tell you what happened one night when they were all going to work .
That night was actually more fun .
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact was changed a little .
It was not a building that he got to go to go , but a building that I was going to go down and holes of water , and you had to jump to jump for it .
(
But then the reality is always clear .
And that 's the beauty of doing things to interact , which people use .
This is a picture of the building with the physicists , the <unk> of water , and they 're all about them .
And this is what we brought to think about the next project I 'm going to show you .
Imagine that they could start to fly .
Imagine you could have a little bit in the air and that each one had a little hole that changes from color as if it was a cloud that moves in space .
This is the video .
Imagine a helicopter , as we saw before , that moves with each other in it .
We could form this cloud .
And a kind of <unk> screen like this with a two dimensions in two dimensions .
Or a normal , but in three dimensions , in which what it changes is the light , not the position .
You can play with a different type .
Imagine that the screen 's going on in different scales and signals , in different types of feeling .
And then then , that would all that I could be a cloud cloud , which you can come back , and to see , and see it from very very different .
This is the real <unk> <unk> , going into the bottom to form a stage , like before .
When you look at light , you see this . The same thing we saw before .
Imagine each of them as a person .
We can have each <unk> with one of people , of the movement of people , etc. , etc .
I want to show you something for the first time .
We 've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the world 's best waves of today , the star of the <unk> of New York City , and they use it as a sign for the <unk> movements , and they use it as <unk> .
So here , we can see <unk> .
On the left , you look at the road , we get it in different places .
It 's so much special in real time as it 's called movement .
You can get all the movement .
You can get all the road .
And once we have the thing , we can play with them , with the color and the movement , with religion , with religion .
We want to use this as a possible to the <unk> .
I wanted to show you the last project in which we 're working .
It 's something for the <unk> of London .
It 's called the <unk> .
And the idea is , imagine again , we could take the people to do something and change our environment , as a <unk> environment as a <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , but with a cloud .
Imagine we could do that all of a little bit for a <unk> .
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last years , is that , in the last two decades , we spend the physical world to the digital world .
We 've invented everything , like knowledge , and it 's accessible through the Internet .
Today , for the first time , and the Museum of Obama will be the <unk> , we can spend the digital world , the power of the networks , the physical world .
In our case , this can we want to use to design and make a symbol .
That would be built something built in a city .
But I could be to address the challenges of today : think about climate change or the emissions of CO2 , how do we spend the digital world to the digital world ?
The idea is that we can do that people are going to do this together with this together .
The cloud is a cloud , again , made out of the same way that the real cloud is a cloud system .
And those particles are water , as that in our cloud are .
It 's a physical structure in London , but they did n't know .
You can move through it , have different experiences .
You can see from the bottom , you 'll be able to share the main moments of the <unk> , and even more , and it can be used as a way of connection with the community .
So , it 's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up , as a new top of London .
You can get there .
And as if it was a new <unk> <unk> in night , but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who go to the top .
Thank you .
I 'd like to be better than you are ?
Imagine you told you that , with just a lot of changes in their genes , they could improve the memory -- for a more efficient , more way .
Or maybe I would like to be in the best way , being more strong , have more resistance .
I 'd like to be more honest and sure about themselves ?
What do you live with good health ?
Or maybe they 're from those people who always wanted to be more creative .
What is what I would like ?
What would I like , if you could choose something ?
( Audience member Audience : Thank you .
How many people make creativity ?
Your hand . Let me see .
A lot . You know , they probably had to the amount of creative people .
That 's very good .
How many of the memory ?
A few more .
And the physical state ?
A little bit less .
What do the longevity ?
Ah , most of them , that makes me feel very well as a doctor .
If you could have something of this the world would be very different .

Or maybe possible ?
The evolution has been a <unk> subject here in the TED Prize , but today I want to give you the watch of a doctor on the topic .
Now , the great one of the 20th century , <unk> . <unk> , which also <unk> in the World <unk> <unk> , wrote a trial called `` No in biology has a sense of <unk> . ''
But if you actually give you the biological evolution seen this : it 's about the past , or the future ?
Does the other or us ?
This is another look at the tree of life .
The human part of this work , well in a end , it 's , of course , the most of us .
<unk> of a common identity with the modern entrepreneurs have a few or eight billion years .
In the fact , there 's been maybe 20 25 different species .
Some have gone up and become .
We 've been here a few years ago .
It could seem that we 're very far from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , in the most of the basic <unk> of our cells is more or less .
You can realize that we can harness and control the <unk> of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human equality that is used to treat diabetes ?
This is not like human equality ; but it 's the same protein , and it 's the same protein , which comes out of it .
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all got in the most bacteria that we have in the world we have in the rest of the body ?
Maybe 10 times more .
I mean , you think about -- when you think about it , you know , when you look at you , you think about bacteria ?
The gut is a <unk> environment for those bacteria .
It 's a high , dark , it 's a lot of it .
And we 're going to get all the nutrients that you can want to want to do without complex .
It 's really like a quick way for the bacteria in the fact of some <unk> <unk> to the way .
But , for the other , we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria that they 're essential for our life .
They 're going to be able to get the essential water , and we get all of certain disease .
But what do we do the future ?
We 're in a sort of balance as a species ?
Or they 're going to make it in something different , something maybe better .
In this sort of <unk> , the life in the universe , life in Earth is like a short person -- the animal kingdom , as a only <unk> , and human life , and human life , and human life , a little bit of <unk> .
That was us .
And it was also the top of this talk about this talk , so I hope you know .
When I 'm going to college to college , I had my first kind of biology .
I was fascinated by the Sahara and the beauty of biology .
I was in the power of the evolution , and I realized about something important : most of the existence of life , in terms of life , every cell , every cell energy from that cell , and all the genetic energy of that cell would come to the two cells .
But when there are the organisms , the things start to change .
It 's going to look at the sexual reproduction .
And something very important : with the bottom of the sexual reproduction that happens the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
In fact , you could say that the <unk> of the body comes on in evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction .
I have to convince you that when I was a student student thought , well , <unk> , <unk> , death for sex ; it seemed pretty reasonable in that moment , but with every year that happened , every time I had more clear .
I was starting to understand the feelings of George <unk> , which still had been born in Britain in their 90 years .
And one night when you go to your hotel door .
He took the door .
And we 've got to find a very amazing dancer , <unk> .
He looked at it , and he says , `` I was going to go back from a <unk> . ''
`` It 's well , '' says George , `` I 'm going to show it . ''
I realized , as a doctor , which was working by a different goal to the goal of evolution ; not necessarily it , not a different .
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted to make us healthy .
I wanted to get health in the disease .
I wanted to grow more and more healthy .
The evolution is going to go to the genome to the next generation , and we were able to get a generation of generation .
From a point of view of view you , and I can be like a rockets , because we 're like a <unk> .
And I think that all of the feeling that we 're going to call it out , when he said , `` I do n't want to get the increase through my work .
I want to go back . ''
The evolution is not necessarily by the longevity .
It 's not necessarily in the biggest or the most strong or the more fast or even the more smart .
The evolution is to the best creatures to their environment .
That 's the only test test .
In the bottom of the ocean , the <unk> bacteria that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that they 're going to be , if they had fish there , fish , and they have done that , and they have to do that a whole environment .
So , what does this , when we look at what it 's happening in evolution and if you 're going to think about the place of humans in evolution , and in particular , if we look at to go back to go back , to the next line , and I would say it 's a lot of possibilities .
The first is that no <unk> .
We 've got a sort of balance .
And the <unk> , it would be that for medicine , in the first place , we 've been able to preserve the great amount of genes that we would have been done , and then it 's the population .
And in second place , as a species , we 've been able to be our environment to be able to get us to us as we get us to us .
And by the way , we 've got it , <unk> , and we 'll be able to be able to be able to have the faith that is not possible to have the faith for the evolution .
A second possibility is that it 's a evolution of the modern kind of modern , natural , because of nature of nature .
And the argument here would be , that the <unk> of evolution would take up , but they are <unk> .
And in the <unk> , when a sort of <unk> planets are going to have the faith and the environmental changes that can produce evolution of natural .
But there 's a third possibility , a possibility , frankly and <unk> .
I call it <unk> , the new evolution , which is not only natural -- but it 's a lot of light for us as individuals in the decisions .
Now , how could happen ?
How could we get to do this ?
First of fact the reality that many people today , in some cultures , they are making decisions about their appearance .
In some cultures , they are able to have more young women who women .
It 's not a good necessarily necessarily for society , but it 's what you get to the individual and family .
Now , you know , if it 's going to be able to choose to choose not only the sex of their appearance , but , in your own body to make the human , to make the resources to cure or prevent disease .
And if we could make the genetic changes for the <unk> , or the disease or reduce the risk of cancer , or we put it up ?
Do n't you do that changes in their genes ?
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be each more possible .
And the Nobel exhibition started in October and 13 years ago .
<unk> <unk> billion dollars .
At the next year , in 2004 , I could be done the same work for 20 billion dollars in three four months .
Today , you can get a whole sequence of the three billion pairs of the human genome in the human genome to a cost to the $ five and in a week .
I do n't have a lot for that that 's actually the human genome for millions and to be every time in all of all .
They get those changes .
Now , the same technology that has produced the human equality in bacteria can not be able to protect them from them , but they 're going to protect them against their other viruses .
And there 's not a particular trial in course with the <unk> vaccine in stem cells in stem cells .
Can you imagine something good than it ?
That 's actually today , and in the future is going to be each more possible .
Imagine there , only other changes .
They can change the cells of their bodies , but if you could change the cells of their own ?
And if you could change the sperm and the teachers , or to change the <unk> <unk> , and give their children a best chance of a more healthy life , whether diabetes , by the <unk> , the <unk> of cancer ?
Who do n't want children more healthy ?
And then , that same same technology , that same engine of the science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , we 'll also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Why do n't have the sum of a little bit about all if you could <unk> with the next generation of the planet ?
Why do n't have a muscle , we do n't have a muscle , that we can move more fast and more distance ?
Why do n't do more time ?
This is going to be .
And when we 're in conditions of what this is the next generation and we can put the attributes that we wanted to have to have the evolution of before .
We 're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years , and we can spend a billion years , and maybe in the next 100 years .
These are choices that their grandchildren , or the grandchildren of their grandchildren , you 're going to have to have to have to get to them .
We 're going to use these choices in a better society , more successful , more likely ?
Or , we 're going to choose very different attributes that we want to do for some of us but not for others ?
We 're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more likely ?
This is the kind of question we 're going to do .
And the more deep thing of everything : We 're going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom we need to take these decisions ?
To bad , and before you could think about , these choices are going to depend from us .
Thank you .
Imagine a big explosion when you 're going to go back from a little explosion .
Imagine a full plane full of smoke .
Imagine a engine doing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Well , I had a car car . I was sitting in the <unk> .
It was the only thing I could talk about the hour .
So I looked at you , and they said , `` There 's no problem . You know , `` No problem . ''
And the line was taken up the plane , and we were n't so far .
You could see Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things on the same time .
The <unk> <unk> the plane with the river .
These is not the route .
<unk> the motors .
Imagine to be in a airplane and without a little bit .
And then he said three words .
The three words else you 've heard .
He said , `` <unk> for the impact . ''
I did n't have to talk about the <unk> .
I was able to see it in their eyes .
It was hidden . Your life became .
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself .
I learned that everything changes in a moment .
We have this list of things to do before , these things we want to do in life , these things we want to do in life , and I thought in all the people that I wanted to get , and I thought in all of the people who wanted to get , and I did n't have .
While I thought in that else , he came up a phrase , which is , `` Let 's get a bad answers . ''
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I 'm going to open .
I do n't want to ask it in life in life .
And that uses , that 's really changed my life .
The second I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the bridge George Washington , which was not for a lot -- I thought about , I thought , I thought , I thought a big even .
I 've lived a good life .
In my humanity and with my mistakes , I 've been able to improve everything I did .
But in my humanity also give me to my heart .
And I 'm telling the time that I 'm able to be in things that do n't know with people who know .
And I thought in my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
And then , as <unk> in that , I decided to look at the top of my life .
It 's not perfect , but it 's a lot better .
In two years I do n't have a fight with my wife .
They feel about you .
I do n't try to have the reason ; it 's going to be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and this is how you go here , `` 15 , 14 . ''
You see the <unk> water .
I 'm saying , `` Please . ''
I do n't want to know that in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk> .
And while <unk> , I had the feeling of it , they die not day .
It 's almost like that we 've been able to be <unk> for it all our life .
But it was very sad .
I did n't want to go , I love my life .
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thinking , which is , only wish one thing .
I wish to see my children grow .
One month later , I was in a performance of my daughter -- I was the first degree , not a lot of creative , not , and I said , it 's like a little .
And for me , that was all the reason to be the reason of being the world .
In that point , I understood those two points , which is the only thing about my life is being a great parent .
On all , the only goal I have in life is being a good parent .
I got a ceiling , they 're not dying that day .
And I got a gift , which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way .
You know , you 're looking at today , the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in his plane -- and please that do n't be like -- but if you see it ?
What is what you would do , you 're still able to do because you think you 're going to live around ?
How do you change their relationships and energy energy in them ?
And the most important thing , they are being the best parents who can ?
Thank you .
Now , I 've been born in life with many projects .
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy .
The guy is called <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the '80s .
One day came to his house after a left , and he said , `` Oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . ''
And that was the beginning of 2030 .
Today , you 've got to have a total <unk> .
You can only use the eyes .
Their work in me .
I have an design company , and a animation that , obviously , whether it 's something we know that we 're able to do and decide in the world of art .
So we decided that we were going to go back to this , <unk> , and to their cause .
So I went up and came up with his brother and his father and I said , `` Let 's give you this money .
What are you going to do with him ? ''
And his brother said , `` I just want to be able to talk about it , I just want to talk about this again .
I just want to be able to stop with him , and he 's able to communicate with me . ''
And I said , `` A second , it 's not that you 've seen in Stephen <unk> , is not that all people who can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to communicate by
And he said , `` No , unless you have a important thing , and you have a very good sure you ca n't do it .
These devices are not about the people . ''
And I said , `` Well , how do they communicate then ? ''
Somebody to seen the movie , `` The <unk> and it ? ''
They communicate from that way -- you 're going on with the finger .
And I said , `` That 's following . ''
So I looked at the only desire to give you a step , and I 'm going to be a step , and I 'm going to be a step that I did n't have the top of how I was going to sleep .
I would take me with his brother and with his father there , `` All right , this is the attempt to talk , we 're going to build a machine , and we 're going to find a way to make their art , and we 're going to find a way to make their art again .
Because it 's ridiculous that somebody who have so much in their inside . ''
So I talked at a conference a couple of months later .
I met these guys called <unk> , which have a technology that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to find a light in any surface , and then , with a bubble , you know about that , and that 's the negative space .
So you 're going to make some of art .
All of the things that are , they say , they 're part of a cycle of life .
Now , we 've done with the sex rate , then with the bad words , then with the <unk> , then in the end , people start to make art .
But there was always a cycle of life in their chest .
And so I started the journey .
And about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , and then a lot to move the things of one side , we had a couple of things .
One , we do the end of the <unk> companies , and we get a machine to be able to be able to communicate , a machine as the <unk> of <unk> .
What was great .
And it 's a lot of fun , I call it <unk> , I call it <unk> because I 'm going to talk to the guy , you get a kid , and you said , `` Do n't do it . This guy 's great . ''
The other thing we did was to bring to seven programmers from all the world 's <unk> from all the <unk> of the <unk> to our house .
My wife , the children and me , we went back to the garage , and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the control of the house .
A lot of our friends thought that we did something really mean , and when you could have the <unk> of the walls of the walls and in their place would have .
But for two weeks <unk> , we went back to the walk of course , my son was part , my dog also , and we create this .
It 's called <unk> : <unk> , and you can see the object .
They 're a couple of <unk> of the sun that we live in the walk of a <unk> , something of <unk> , and things of <unk> , and the other thing .
We take a <unk> camera , we put it , the <unk> on a light light and now there 's a device that 's free -- we put the code to be a place , we put the code to be low the software .
And we create a device that does n't have chaos in all .
There 's no company company that say `` No . ''
There 's no hospital that can say `` No . ''
Any person with him today has access to draw and communicate using their eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you very much to you .
So , at the end of the two weeks , the two weeks ago .
I love this picture because this is the room in another person and that 's his room .
There was all of this <unk> and <unk> for the great window .
And after more than a year of coral , two weeks of plastic , buy the night of all the night , she turned up to draw for the first time in seven years .
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the system of their life , and it 's looking at through the entire system of their life .
I got the bed to bed that I could see .
And we put a website on a wall of the parking parking wall .
And he got to draw by the first time in front of his family and friends , and you can see what it was the feeling in the parking parking .
The funny thing was that we had to do in the parking parking way , so we feel like we were able to be able to get it out of the <unk> .
At the end of this he gave us a email , and this was what we said , `` This was the first time I was born in seven years .
I felt as if I had been under the water , and someone finally came to <unk> , and I 'll put it back to <unk> , and I 'll go back from there . ''
Is n't wonderful ?
In some way that 's our war .
That 's what we do in movement , developing .
And we have a long way to go with this .
It 's a great device , but it 's the equivalent of a <unk> device .
Somebody with this very successful potential deserves more .
So we 're trying to figure out how to figure out how to do and do it , and they do it .
And since we 've had all sorts of performance .
We 've got a lot .
Remember , it 's free ; none of us are doing money with this .
All of our own pockets .
They 're going to take them , `` Oh , this is great . ''
I chose something about us , and then , in December , the magazine magazine gave us as one of the biggest 50 variety of 2010 , and it was really great .
The best thing about all of this , and this is what it ended up from close to the <unk> is that in front of this year in the <unk> center , to have a exhibition called `` <unk> in the <unk> . ''
And `` <unk> in the <unk> '' is going to have the best <unk> of the <unk> art , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all of them are going to be there .
It 's going to be in the show that it 's pretty amazing .
So , basically this is my idea : if you see something that 's not possible , do it possible .
None of what there is in this room was possible , the computer , the computer , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
We can be -- any thing about this room .
I 'm not a professor , I 've never made anything with technology 's technology ; I just know something , and I 'm going to get it up with a wonderful people to do that happen .
And these are the questions that I want you to do all the day when we find us with something that we have to do . If you do n't know , if you do n't mean , if you do n't mean , who ?
Thank you .
I 've spent the last few years ago , very hard , and at the same time a dangerous time .
I went to jail , hard .
I worked in a coal of coal -- dangerous .
And in rural areas , hard and dangerous .
And I spent 30 days to only do this -- fun to the beginning , something hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
In fact , in a big part of my career , I 've been able to be <unk> in situations on the only goal of trying to try to the only goal of trying to try to the only goal of trying to try to the actual issues of ways that we 'll be able to teach humans , interesting , and , with lucky , they 're able to
So , when I knew you go here to do a question about the world of the office and the fact I wanted to do something a little different .
So , some of some you can have heard , or not , a couple of weeks I got a couple of weeks ago .
I 'm going to get a few messages in Facebook , some in Twitter , I was born in the high rights of the name of the name of 2011 .
What I had was the next thing : `` <unk> <unk> <unk> : I 'm going to call it out of it : I was my question of which you do n't have idea about what it 's about , and as it could <unk> it in the face , especially if I put it on it .
But he said this , it 's a very good opportunity . ''
Do you know how many people look at these surgery ?
Many .
It 's a doctor in progress , by the way .
So , there 's still with that first knew that somebody was going to buy the rights rights .
If I had me asked me a year I would n't have been able to tell you .
But in the new film in which I 'm working , we looked at the world of mental , of the advertising .
And as I said earlier , I 've got to look at these bad situations in the last few years , but I could n't get it , but I could be <unk> , and so dangerous as they go to the rooms with these guys .
You see , I had this idea for a film .
RG <unk> : I want to do a film that 's going from the <unk> of products , the disease and the advertising , and that all the film is going on with <unk> of products .
And the movie is going to call `` The biggest film would have come up . ''
What happens in `` The biggest film would have come up , '' is that all of the bottom in the end of the end of the end , has images images , all the time -- from the <unk> that would be before the title , the <unk> .
Now , here , <unk> , the <unk> Center .
Those people would get to the film to go on .
And so the film begins all of this idea . ( Michael <unk> : It 's happy . It 's `` Do you get it .
I 'm a question . ( billion : I 'll just tell you . It was more enough .
It was `` No . ''
But we 're not just going to have the rise of the <unk> , but we 're going to do sure about the <unk> , but we 're going to ask you to make sure all the categories that we could in the film .
Maybe it 's going to take a shoe , and it becomes the most great famous .
And the most great car that you 've got to put it in `` The biggest film ever come on , '' the best <unk> that you 've got to have , from `` The biggest film would have come up . ''
<unk> <unk> : The idea is then also also like to show you as a part of life , do you do that <unk> the film ? ( Audience : Now , we actually show the whole process of how it works .
The goal of the whole film is transparency .
You 're going to see all the process in this film .
That 's the whole idea , all the film , in beginning to end .
And I would love to teach you to do that happen .
Robert magazine : You know , it 's funny because it 's the first time I hear that ; it 's the little respect by the audience .
<unk> : No , I do n't know how it 's going to be people to be people .
<unk> : You have a perspective -- I do n't know if `` Wow , '' is very <unk> , but you know how it 's going to do it ?
Now , a million and a half and a half and a half and a half .
<unk> : You know , maybe for the moment that the film is going to look like a lot of us as a lot of clout .
DH : What you think it 's going to be the answer ?
<unk> <unk> : most of the answers to be `` No . ''
DH : But it 's hard to join it , by the film or to be me ?
Man : All things .
DH : It means that you 're not very optimistic .
So , they help me ?
MK : I can help .
DH : Very good . ( Music : OK .
MK : We have to think about what .
DH : Yeah . ( YR : That 's the challenge . When you look at the people who you have to try .
MK : We have some places to go .
Second : I thought , `` Look at the camera , '' I would have a conversation on the microphone .
<unk> the camera means `` We do n't want to know anything of your film . ''
DH : And so it was , one of one , all of these companies .
You do n't want to have nothing to see with this film .
I was surprised .
They do n't want to know about this project .
And I was very surprised ; I thought that the concept of advertising , it was the product as many people like it can be possible , so many people can see it as possible .
It 's interested in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of media media , it 's not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle kingdom is going to take the message to the air ?
No , that was what I thought .
But the problem was , you see , that my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this .
Actually , not , no mistake .
There was no mistake in all .
This would have been good .
But the problem was what represents this picture .
See , when you look at images of <unk> '' in Google is -- this is one of the first images that are going on .
I like your way to get it . No . No .
This was the problem : transparency , free , free , you know , you know , you do n't know , you do n't know , you do n't know , it 's a <unk> , but they 're able to make the information or make the information or make the information .
You see , we heard a lot about transparency in these days .
Our political <unk> , the president of it , even the <unk> .
But from a sudden when it 's about how to make it a sudden .
But why ? And why ?
It 's clear -- like this amazing way .
And it 's also a lot .
What else is there ?
<unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
That 's very risky .
When I started talking with the companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , `` No , we want you to tell you .
We want you to tell you a story , but it 's going to make it a story . ''
See , when I was a child , and my father gave me in some guy , and there 's he said , `` Oh , there 's three sides in every story .
It 's your story , it 's my story , and it 's the real story . ''
As you see , in this film wanted to tell the real story .
But with only a company , a <unk> , and that would just tell us , and that was only because I knew to John hatred and Richard <unk> , I realized that I would have to go for me , I would have to take them to go to me , I would have to take them in the point and go to the companies .
So what I started looking at a sudden , I started to tell me , is that when you start to talk about the idea of the idea of understanding you is a universal problem .
DH : I have friends who do big films , huge , plastic , rich and others who do small films , <unk> , like mine .
And my friends who do with the big book of large , autonomous , say that the reason that their movies have so successful is that they have .
And then my friends who do <unk> films who say , `` Well , how we 're going to do with these big , giant movies movies ? ''
And the movie is called `` The most big film never . ''
How are we going to see it specifically on the movie ?
Every time I 'm going to come up , every time I had to put my <unk> , you 'll see the question .
In any moment for a interview with somebody , I can say , `` You 're good for this interview ?
You 're ready ? You see a little nervous .
I want to help you to tell you .
Maybe you should take a little of this before the interview . ''
And there 's one of these <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> '' like `` <unk> <unk> '' you 're going to have their opportunity .
We 're going to have a lot of man as a woman , a <unk> , to <unk> , in <unk> , as well .
That 's the general look .
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> .
Frank Frank : We are a little bit .
Let 's look at the kind of films with small films , we are more good .
So we do n't have the budget that have other messages .
So to do things like this , you know , you know the reason to people is the reason why we 're interested in .
DH : What words would use to describe it ?
It is in white .
KS : That 's a great question .
Woman : The top .
DH : It 's not the way you want to describe something that you want to describe something that you do is in the <unk> .
Man : Let 's talk about something .
I think , `` bread , '' is a great word that actually gets to this category in a positive , and they get the smell , and the fish . ''
You 're going to get you .
How do you take you more time ?
So things like those who would get the benefits .
DH : And that 's a <unk> company .
What 's about me ? What 's a common guy ?
I need to talk to the streets of the street , people like me , to the common <unk> .
They have to talk about me .
DH : How do you change you ?
Man : Let me ask me ?
I do n't know .
I like the good clothes .
Woman : I 'm going to get the '80s , <unk> <unk> .
DH : It 's well , what 's the <unk> ?
<unk> : There 's a only . ( Audience : I guess that the kind of gender , the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk> .
I like a lot of the dark colors , a lot of <unk> and things like this .
And so I 'm going to be able to go out of the sun , or I like the tissues and similar .
Woman : If you take it out of it , it could be a <unk> <unk> .
Man 2 : The fact I 'm going to be , I call it <unk> .
Your two : In part of them , in part of the <unk> , in part of <unk> <unk> .
Man three : I 'm the kind of the Florida .
<unk> toys in the country and in the world .
So I guess that 's my Ph.D. .
In my small sector , that 's my <unk> .
Man three : My letter is funny because we get it .
Man five : You 've got <unk> .
Is that something ?
<unk> : I 'm a lawyer .
I took : I 'm writing .
DH : Well , we do n't know , we can not be seen , but often I 'm often going to get it in the intersection of <unk> <unk> .
I realized I needed a machine .
I needed somebody who could go in my head , somebody who could tell you to understand what it call the `` Okay . ''
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> .
They have helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , we 'll try to discover that again .
If they could do it for them , you could probably do it for me .
<unk> : <unk> the pictures , right ?
DH : Yeah . The first picture is a family picture .
Man : Let 's give you a little thing about your thoughts and feelings your way to be .
Now , these people are looking at my way to see the world .
Man : You know , you know about that world .
MK : The world ? I think your world is the world in which you live -- like people who come on , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
All of those things , and they start in a place , and in my case , and they start in my family , in New Delhi .
Man : What is the next thing you want to talk about ?
DH : The next is `` This was the best day of my life . ''
Man : How do this with your thoughts , feelings and your way to be ?
DH : It 's like who would like to be .
I like the different things .
I like the amazing things . I like things .
Man : Now , `` Well , `` Why , '' for what ?
What is you ? Now , what 's going ?
Why is it important to see ? What represents the red ?
Let 's give you a little bit about that .
A little more than you are not who are .
What else does you have ?
Now , you do n't have to have fear . So what 's kind of the mountain right ?
DH : <unk> ! ( Thank you .
Man : Thank you for your <unk> . ( Audience : Great work : Thank you very much .
DH : Yes , I do n't know what 's going to come from this .
I 've been interested in all this .
<unk> <unk> : The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different parts , but they 're going to go , in your personality personality , the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's very good together .
And I think there 's almost a paradox in them .
And I think some of them only <unk> in one of their strong dots or in the other in the other time in our own .
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things of the things that they do n't care -- they get the fear of the things that they do n't care ; they get the fear , and you actually do it , and you do that you 're going to do something positive for you .
What else are you ?
The first here is the <unk> , Apple .
And you can see here , also , here 's going to sleep , you know , I 'm going to lose <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Now , there 's the <unk> , and you 're trying to know , those things who have come up and come from , but it 's a <unk> <unk> is something very powerful .
DH : One <unk> <unk> . What is you ?
If you say , if somebody would you ask your identity identity , your personality ?
Do you have a bad <unk> ? You 're somebody who makes the blood .
Or are you more well , you 're more good .
A little bit more idealistic , it 's true ?
It 's just like to be a <unk> to be as <unk> , South , South , <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , and it 's a bit of a <unk> , but it 's a bit like <unk> .
Or are you more well from the catalyst ?
You 're aware , sophisticated as <unk> ?
Do you have a lot of , the traditional , <unk> , you know ?
You 're happy , stable , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> or <unk> ?
In the course of this film , we had to come back to 500 companies , and they get up , who said `` No , '' who said `` No , '' I would n't want to be able to be part of this project .
They do n't want to have nothing to see with this film , especially because they do n't have control , you do n't have control in the end of the end .
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> , and we 've got to tell the story in this film of how they use the <unk> of the desire in the world , so that 's so much a huge strategy like a film .
We went to San Francisco where they 've been able to be able to the <unk> air .
In all the city for the past five years , there 's no fun , there 's no fun , there 's no fun , nothing .
And we went back to school in the ones that companies are made up in schools with problems problems in the U.S. .
The amazing thing for me is that the projects in which I 've had the biggest response or where I 've had more successful , are those in the ones that I 've got to do with things directly .
And that 's what they made these .
<unk> to the <unk> , they came to their molecules , and they said , maybe these agencies do n't have my own interest in mind .
I 'm going to try through the artist .
I 'm going to work with him to create something different , something that 's going to do with people , which is going to challenge the way we look at the world .
And how do you have gone ?
Well , since that the movie came on in the Grand Sea , let 's look at it .
According to <unk> the movie came on in January , and since this is not <unk> , we 've got a couple billion times in the media for this film .
This is just a period of two weeks and a half weeks .
That 's only in line -- no press , or the press .
The movie is still <unk> .
It 's not not in line . It 's not in <unk> .
You do n't even have taken in other countries still .
In the last thing , this film has been started to win .
And it 's not wrong because there 's almost all of the challenges that we talked about their customers , not part .
I always think that if you look at , if you take risks , which in those risks , that we have opportunities .
I think when you take to the people of that is moving to failure .
And I think when you get to their employees in the risk of the risk is sent to all their company to be able to make it .
I feel that what 's going to be going to be able to move to people to do .
We have to try to people who do n't have afraid of the opportunities that you can have <unk> .
In the last thing , I think we have to give them to the fear .
We have to put that sex in a tent .
<unk> the fear .
On a <unk> , we have to get the risk .
And , in course , we have to be able to control transparency .
Today , I 'm going to never go back to go back to get a long road .
And I said this , and transparency and transparency , all of my talk , the <unk> <unk> has been made by my good friends of <unk> who who 's for the name of the name in <unk> .
<unk> : It 's big data in big opportunities for all the world .
<unk> is called `` <unk> . ''
Thank you very much .
Second magazine : And then , in the name of the transparency , which happened exactly with those <unk> .
DH : It 's a fantastic question .
In my own pocket , I have a name of the TED organization of TED , the Grand Foundation , a step for a <unk> to be taken to me to be taken to me to the TED .
Now , the idea behind of the social material is actually very simple .
We do n't want you to Iran .
His biggest center to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that you see are systems systems .
If we were able to create these systems , and cows , we can create a lot of problems with the countryside .
The <unk> <unk> do n't use software , they are a completely different technology .
But if we were able to put a <unk> virus in a laptop computer cell used for a engineer , for a engineer , and then we 're ready .
This is the plan behind .
We started with a <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> to the gray box , cows , and the nuclear , and the nuclear program is known , mission .
It 's easy .
I want to tell you how we found this .
And when we started working with six months six months ago , the purpose was completely important .
The only thing I knew is that it 's very , very complex in the part of the day , the <unk> would have a lot of <unk> .
I wish to want to do something with these <unk> , these systems systems .
That tells us the attention , and we started a experiment in the environment , and we saw what happened with this .
So , we got very little things .
He came up as a half of lab that I do n't like to be like our noise : what 's it , but I did n't want to eat .
I did n't have sense for me .
And then we 've been able to experience with different pieces of noise , I realized , and I thought , this is a attack .
It 's completely playing . ''
The <unk> is looking at the <unk> box if you find a specific system , and even if the program that 's trying to treat it is actually working on that place , and even if the program that 's trying to perceive it .
If you do n't , ladies does n't know .
So , I called my attention , and we started working in this almost 24 hours to the day , because I thought , `` We do n't know what 's the goal . ''
It could be , let 's say for example , a plant plant of the U.S. or a chemistry in Germany .
They 're going to get the goal soon .
And so we cut up and <unk> the code code , and we found that I was in a digital code : a little and a big .
We also saw it , they were also trained by people who obviously had all the information information .
<unk> all of the dots that to play .
You can probably know how much they go to the garden .
So you know everything .
And if you 've heard that the <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology , let me tell you , the light is very complex .
It 's very part of everything we 've seen before .
Here you see a shows of this code code .
We 're talking about about 15 billion lines of code .
It looks like the old language .
I want to tell you how to tell you how we could find sense to this code .
The thing that we put at the beginning of the system , because we know what they do .
And then we went back to <unk> and structures structures , and we were trying to <unk> with the real world , with natural goals .
We need to think about us that we can go to or <unk> .
To get a theories about goals , you remember that it 's not a violent <unk> , but it has to be a <unk> , and it 's probably a <unk> , and it 's not where most of the infections has been <unk> .
You do n't have several thousands of goals in that area .
We basically spread to the nuclear power of <unk> energy and the plant of <unk> <unk> .
So I said to me , `` <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants plants between our customers . ''
And I called it , and I 'll tell you in a effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data .
And it worked pretty well .
So we were able to have the little <unk> <unk> with the control .
It is that part of a cell in the bathroom , that black object you see .
If you get the speed of this reactor , it 's still <unk> and even to do it , and even to do it .
What we also saw it is that the goal of the attack was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get back to the young engineers , so they could n't solve this rapidly .
We 're trying to figure out the digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures .
So , for example , the number of <unk> <unk> in that code , you ca n't be <unk> .
I started a scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they 're done in what it 's called a waterfall , and each of it has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That was a sense , there was a coincidence .
And they put better .
These <unk> in Iran , you 're taken up in 15 parts called glass .
And guess what we found in the origami code ?
There 's a almost <unk> structure .
So again , that was a good bit .
This is a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands .
Now , for it , there 's not like .
The results have been sitting after many weeks of hard work .
<unk> <unk> , and we had to go back to start .
And so , we found that these both digital <unk> <unk> to one and the same goal , but from different .
The little <unk> is going to take a waterfall , and they do it and do it , and <unk> , and the big <unk> gets up with six , and it 's going to play English .
In addition , we 're very surprised in that we 've got a lot of what it is .
It 's <unk> , and it 's just <unk> .
We do n't have to talk about that other goals are <unk> by campus .
Here I show you a very interesting things that we saw , really me .
There 's the <unk> box , and you see the <unk> .
So what this thing does is to visualize the values of the sensors for example , of the sensors , of the sensors , and the sensors of foods and uses code , which is still going to go to the attack , which is still going to go through the attack , with a musical data .
And I think , it 's not , these data data 's data are <unk> by campus .
It 's like in the movies of teachers where , during the <unk> , the <unk> camera came up from the video .
Is it great ?
Now , the idea here is obviously not only <unk> in the fourth of control .
It 's really much more dangerous and happy .
The idea is <unk> a digital system system .
We need the digital systems of digital security where a human car could n't act fast .
For example , in a cost of energy , when the big crises of entertainment is happening on speed , you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to open English attack .
Of course , this is not to do it a human .
This is where we need to be very genetic systems .
And when they 're trained , then you can spend things bad .
The plant can happen .
And it 's not the <unk> system .
That does .
But it can be worse .
What I 'm going to say is very important .
Think about this . This attack is about .
You do n't have nothing to see , specifically with <unk> , with <unk> <unk> .
It could work also , for example , in a plant plant , or in a <unk> factory .
It 's true .
And you do n't have . It 's going to make this process with a amazing key , as we saw in the case of Iraq .
You can also use technology .
<unk> the more possible .
And if you start that , with what <unk> is with a mass destruction .
That 's the consequence we need to face .
Unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for such whether is not in the East .
It 's in the United States and Japan .
All of the green areas are spaces with large number of goals .
We need to face the consequences , and better that we start to do now .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I have a question .
In fact , it has been public in a lot of place that people know that the <unk> is the main desert behind this .
What is your mind ?
<unk> <unk> : OK , really want to hear this ?
Yeah . Okay .
My mind is that the <unk> is involved , but the engine is not Israel .
The engine behind this is the <unk> .
There 's a single thing , and that 's the United States , fortunately , fortunately .
Because , in another way , our problems would be even bigger .
CA : Thank you for <unk> . Thank you .
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take , and they wanted to be able to be able to <unk> , or another that do you do , or another that do you make them users users , and you go to walk .
In `` <unk> <unk> , '' we call these robots .
They are not nothing different from something that is in the morning , you give you a great force , which is also a great force , which is also going to make their speed , and they help me , for example , to make the balance .
It 's actually the true of the man and the machine .
But it 's not just that -- you can see it , and it 's going on the universe , and with some of the <unk> .
This is not a whole idea .
To show you now in what we 're working to talk about the American soldier that , in average , you have to take on their back back to the top of 45 kilos , and it 's going to take a little team .
Now , here , this leads to some important of the important test -- except in the back , in 30 percent of the soldiers in the soldiers .
We decided to figure out this challenge and create a brochure that could help make the issue .
Let me introduce you to the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
Man : Now , with the Maldives , I can be able to get 90 kilos for a lot of hours .
Their design design , it allows you to be able to be able to be able to take it up , and a big movements with a lot .
I 'll be able to do , or where I want to go , and then it 's going to go , and then it gets my force and my resistance .
<unk> <unk> : We 're ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this is this again .
Or , it 's a reality .
Let 's go back to the American users users , about what I 'm really happy .
There 's 25 billion people about a lot of people , in Britain , everywhere .
As a one percent of the total population .
And this is a really true calculation .
So we talk about something that happens with often , people , and they 're very young , with damage in the mountains that to start their life -- 20 or 40 years ago -- they know to a wall , and the wheelchair it turns out to be their only option .
We also talk about the population of the population that you find rapidly .
Their only option , many times -- by a brain , or some other , is the wheelchair .
And this has been like that for the last 500 years , from their successful , as I should recognize .
So , we decided to start for writing a new chapter about mobility .
Let me introduce you to you the <unk> that 's using <unk> , who took a <unk> who took a system in the floor , and as a result I could n't go back to walk for 50 years ago , until now .
<unk> <unk> : Thank you .
EB : Thank you , you 're using our <unk> , you know .
It 's a lot of sensors .
It 's completely <unk> in 2005 that they 'll get signals to the computer computer , here in the back .
And also here there is some researchers that give us energy to the engineer in the television , and in the lab , and they do it to go with this very very natural , and very natural .
AB : I was 24 years at the top of my life when , by a strange leap in the air , 60 percent .
In a fraction of second , I lost all a sense and everything movement to go down .
Every time later , a doctor came to my room in the hospital , and he said , `` Wow , I 'll never go back . ''
And that happened a thousand years ago .
So let me go to the last few of my hope from my being .
The technology 's technology since then , he 's allowed to learn about <unk> costs on <unk> , open rocks , and even to put it in their hands .
But they have n't invented anything that I could walk , until now .
Thank you .
EB : As you can see , we have the technology , we have the <unk> , we have the artists to get and talk to you .
It 's in our hands , and we have all the potential here to be able to be able to be able to change the world to future generations -- not just from soldiers , but to all the users users , and all the users users .
Thank you .
I 've got back from a community that has the secret of human survival .
It 's a place where women have the appearance , sex sex to say , and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is something serious .
And not , it 's not the coast of the Man <unk> or San Francisco .
Ladies and gentlemen , you know , you know , you know .
This is the world 's world of the forests of Congo .
The bonobos are , so with the chimps , their children else .
That means that we all share a common identity , a bad grandmother , which lived about six billion years .
Now , the chimpanzees are known by their pants .
But unfortunately , unfortunately , we 've done too much about this aspect of the human evolution .
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
As the chimpanzees are made by big types , the 1970s , the Bonobo society is to the <unk> of females with power .
These guys have created something special , because this leads to a very <unk> society where the deadly violence is still done .
But unfortunately , the bonobos are the less <unk> .
They live in the depths of the <unk> floor , and it 's been very hard to study .
The Congo is a paradox -- a <unk> and beauty and beauty , but also the heart of the <unk> , which has been interested for decades and built almost many deaths as the World War II .
It 's not to tell you that this destruction also is also going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to fly .
The distribution of <unk> , and they do n't do it , you do n't be able to show you , or a <unk> with the bonobos who are in the world -- and unfortunately , we 're not sure that .
But yet , in this land of violence , and it can n't hear the laughter , but it can be heard of the <unk> .
Who are these confusion ?
We know , as the spinal cord , not the war , '' because they have sex sex , <unk> and <unk> to explore conflict and solve social problems .
I 'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity realized that life 's life is more than <unk> <unk> .
On the bonobos , as humans , I love to play the long of all their life .
It 's not just a game game .
To us and for them , and for them , it 's important to use it , and they move the treatment .
With him we learn to trust , and we learn the rules of the game .
Now , the game gets creativity , and it has to see with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of connections .
And when you look at the answer to look at the prediction , the same <unk> , the dance and the human beings .
The game is the glue that makes us .
I do n't know how you play you , but I want to show you a couple of videos , the only <unk> of the <unk> .
First , it 's a game of <unk> , and I 'm not talking about Twitter .
So here we have to a female , and a young person in a half .
Look what 's doing it .
It could be the story of the phrase : `` You 've got to be the story of the balls . ''
I just think that in this case to him , not ?
Yes .
So , the sexual game is common in <unk> as humans .
And this really interesting video is , because it shows -- this really interesting video -- because it shows the <unk> of <unk> elements of the game , and also how the game needs to make trust , and also how the game needs to trust .
But the game is <unk> .
Now , the game is <unk> , you can get a lot of ways , some of which are more likely , you know , if you get the place where you know , you know the place where you do .
And I want you to see -- this is <unk> , a young female , which is playing with water .
I think , as it , sometimes we have their own , and we have all the limits of our worlds and outside .
And it 's that curiosity for us to explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we can have are the real force of creativity .
These are only little samples of the understanding of the understanding that the Bonobo will give us our past and present .
But they also have a secret for our future , a future in which we have to reach a world every more difficult to most creativity and more cooperation .
The secret is the key of these capabilities .
In other words , the game is our <unk> <unk> .
To jump with success to a world that changes we have to play .
But , it 's going to be able to be our ability of play ?
The game is not .
The game is essential .
Now , for the bonobos and humans , life is not just happy and stop .
When it looks like to play to play , you can be the moments in which is the more likely .
That 's why , you show you here , you know this gift of evolution , and they got together together as <unk> creativity , the fish and the guess .
Thank you .
In New York , I 'm responsible for a development of a organization without a <unk> organization called a <unk> .
When I 'm not able to be poverty , <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> in a <unk> body .
And in our city , where they gave them through a different personal child , you have to get to the website of the road very soon to go in action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second test in the site , so I had a very high likelihood of go .
But yet , there was a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in front , and figure out what was our task .
When I found the captain , I was <unk> in a conversation with the fact that without fact about one of the worst days of their life .
We were in the late night , she was a foot outside in the rain , under a pencil , in Argentina , it 's going to go up , while his house was in fire .
The other talk that I had to get before me , <unk> <unk> <unk> came up to the captain , and he asked the dog , and he asked the dog 's dog .
The dog ! I was <unk> . ''
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that , during the rest of their life , would have to tell people who came on in a building to save a live , just because I gave me for five seconds .
Well , I was the following .
The captain was made a <unk> .
He said , `` No , I need to go to the house .
I need to go , <unk> the fire , and you 'll take it to this woman a couple of shoes . ''
I teach it .
It was n't exactly what I was waiting , but I went on the stairs , at the end of the morning , we went to the <unk> <unk> , which is the more or less had taken up from the fire , and he came to the top of a couple of shoes .
I know what you 're thinking , but I 'm not a hero .
I took my return back to the door where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the main door .
I 'll go back from the house for the house of home , like I was able to wait , his advice was a lot more attention than my God .
I had a few weeks later a letter was a letter of the <unk> of home , by the <unk> effort to save their house .
The story that she looked at all about the other thing was that somebody had had a couple of shoes .
I 'm going to be living in the meantime , like in my position as a headline as a headline of <unk> , and you know , in a magic scale , but also about design , and it 's also known to design and connection .
And you know what I 've learned ?
Everything has their importance .
So , when I look at this room to people who have done , or they 're going to make it , and they 're going to do this , very important levels of success I 'd like to explain this .
They do n't wait to win the first million to make the difference in the life of someone .
If you have something to give you , <unk> now .
<unk> food in a room , <unk> a park of the neighborhood .
They 're <unk> .
We do n't all the day we 're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we 're going to be able to make the life of someone .
So , you go to the game ; we get the shoes .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , Mark it .
Mark comet : Thank you .
Now , this may seem strange , but I 'm a big test of the <unk> block .
And the first blocks blocks , we 've been born with a very simple idea : <unk> from <unk> from a <unk> as you know .
Very quickly , these became the largest building building in the world .
They have allowed to build things more large than us , as the buildings or bridges , a ticket .
Now , you know , these blocks have become the pillars of our time .
There was nearly a hundred years later , in 1994 , going to go on this .
And I called the <unk> of <unk> Street .
And in a few years ago , you 'll put them back to all the homes .
It 's estimated that they 've got over 400 billion or 75 or 75 people on the planet .
You do n't have to be a engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or houses .
Let 's put it into it .
You 'll just have a <unk> block , the favorite in the world , and he became a fundamental piece of our imagination .
As so much , exactly that same year , in the Second Street , the next revolution was going to point from <unk> : the new building building .
He was a little unit of plastic , that we would take us from a <unk> world , but we would try to make them from a <unk> world in a world where everything was amazing .
At the way , the <unk> block , the user allows to create a lot of more larger , and more complex .
But there 's a main difference : The band was just to use them .
I do n't know it , that the building blocks of our time are going to the experts , so I decided to change it .
eight years ago , when I was in the University of University , I started to explore the idea of taking the power of the engineers to the hands of artists and designers .
A few years I started to develop <unk> .
I 'm going to show you how it works .
You 'll see it , they are every single different function .
They 're <unk> to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
And the best of everything is that it comes up by 2030 .
So you ca n't look at the wrong way .
They have a code of colors .
The green is the road , the blue is the world , the area is the <unk> and the color color is .
So , there 's only a blue with a blue with a green , and very quickly can start to do to do .
A blue with a green produce .
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a bit .
If we change the button for a <unk> <unk> , which is here , and now we have a light .
And I 'll be able to create the Koran to create more impact and have a sound machine .
I 'm going to stop this .
So more there 's simple game , <unk> are actually very powerful .
In place to have to program , connect and <unk> , <unk> us to program using a very simple person .
To make it more fast or more slow , it would just get this button that makes the <unk> is more fast or faster .
The idea behind <unk> is that it 's a growing collection .
We want to know that all the interactions in the world are going to make you ready to use .
<unk> , sounds , solar solar cells -- everything should be accessible .
We 've given the children to see with them with them .
And it 's been a amazing experience .
The best thing is how they start to understand the little of all the days that does n't learn in schools .
For example , how it works a light of night , or why the door would be become open , or how a iPad would say to the touch .
We also have taken up to school schools .
So , for example , the designers without different experience to play with <unk> with <unk> .
So here you can see , with the <unk> of paper , and we were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to create them .
[ <unk> .
I 've got here a example of a project that have done , it 's a subset of <unk> .
But wait , here 's my favorite project .
It 's a <unk> <unk> that has afraid of the dark .
Now , for these no engineers , <unk> became another material , the computer became another material .
And we want to be that this material is to all of all .
So , it 's a open code .
You can get the website , you see all of the design of design , and it 's going .
We want to create a world of political , <unk> , and because this world in which we live , this technology , is our .
So again , and to invent .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to talk about the popular discoveries .
I work in the solar industry .
And my little company can look at the environment .
<unk> collaboration .
This is a little video of what we do .
You know , I 'll play a moment .
You can take a little bit on to interact .
We can do , we can continue to put the video to one side .
No .
This is not .
All right .
The solar technology is .
Oh , there 's the time ?
All right . Thank you very much .
A couple of years ago , I 've been able to describe the best designers and whatever you 're going to take a year and work in a environment that 's almost everything that they 're supposed to say , we asked them to work on the government .
And the eye was called <unk> for America , and it would be like a few <unk> <unk> .
And we 've got some members every year and we put them to work with the wheel .
In time , I 'm going to tell you in Britain , we get the <unk> world .
They were big applications ; they were working with the soldiers .
Their task is going to show the possibilities of technology .
It 's going to go through .
When it 's a block of the Boston city .
Here 's like if you take a quote , but what it 's really looking for it is that someone would be able to be that when it 's built by the snow because it knows that it 's not very good in the snow because it knows that it 's built by a square meter .
How did you ask to help help help help help help care of this way ?
The past year in Boston , we had a team of <unk> members .
They were there in February , and in that moment , a lot of a lot ago .
They gave us that the city never won these .
But one of the members called Erik <unk> <unk> something more : which the <unk> citizens would be able to make the young men in front of them .
So he made it as a good group , we found a app .
It 's a beautiful application in which you can put a fire .
You know , you know , you know .
And when you do it , you put it a name , in this case he put up .
If you do n't do you , somebody can <unk> .
Or it 's , it has a component in the way .
It 's a modest application .
Maybe it 's the more little of the 21 applications in the past year .
But it does something like any other technology of the government .
And it extends in a <unk> way .
A responsible responsible responsible systems to see this app realized that I could use it , not for the snow , but so that the citizens have gone out of the page .
It 's very important to work from here , but people get the birds .
That 's why we ask the citizens that the monkeys .
And then Seattle decided to make the citizens to be able to do that the citizens would be able to do that .
And Chicago , I 'm going to make people to do that the people are going to go up when you get it .
So , now we know about nine cities that used use .
And this has been able to be able to put up , in a political way and natural .
If you know a little <unk> technology knows that this does n't happen .
It 's a software of software by a couple of years .
The past year in Boston had a team working in a project that took three people for two and a half months .
It was a tool for the parents could choose the best school school for their children .
And then they told us that we 've done by the normal nation would have taken at least two years ago , and then it 's about two billion dollars .
And that 's not nothing .
Now , there 's a project in the power of California , which was going to the moment that to the moment it has spent five billion dollars and it does n't work .
And there 's projects like this in every level of government .
And so a app that 's a couple of days and it becomes a couple of days , it 's a sort of <unk> in the institution of the government .
It used to the best government of work , not like in companies , as much people think that should be .
Not like a technology company , but more like the Internet .
It 's to say , `` No , in the way , and you know .
And that 's important .
But the most important thing about this application is that represents the way of the government that has the new generation that has the new generation ; not as a problem of a institution , but as a problem of action action .
And that 's very good because it turns out that we are very good for the digital action .
And there 's a very big community of people who is building the tools for it together with efficacy .
And it 's not only the <unk> for America , but there are hundreds of people in all the country that they do with applications in all the day in their own communities .
They have n't given by the government .
They have a big competition to that , but it does n't know , it 's going .
And this people know something that we 've lost .
And it 's that if we go back from the feelings of politics , the line in the <unk> <unk> -- and all of those other things that we give us crazy , the government is , in essence , in course , in the words of Tim <unk> : `` What we do together . ''
Now , a lot of people have led the government .
If you . They are one of those people , I 'm going to do it , because things are changing .
People do n't change ; the government know .
And because of the government in the end of us , you remember that of us , you remember that from `` We , the village ? The way I think about the way to produce change .
I did n't know about government when I started with this .
And as a lot of people thought that the government was going to choose people to make people .
Well , after two years I 've got to the conclusion of the government is , about everything , question of <unk> .
This is the center of attention on services and information .
It 's the place that 's going to say if you put them in the United States .
Scott <unk> this call .
He said `` <unk> . ''
I did n't found anything . He started with animal control .
And then he said , `` Hey , you can open the end of the house , they put a good music and see if you go ? ''
And it worked . And so well , for him .
But that 's not the end of the <unk> .
Boston does n't have a center center .
It 's a app , web and cell , called <unk> <unk> .
They do n't know that application .
It was the work of a very smart people from the New Republic of New York City .
One day , this happened really , it 's going to get this saying , `` <unk> in my Prize . I do n't know if it 's dead .
How do I do it to go ? ''
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different .
Scott was talking about person .
In <unk> <unk> , so you can all see this .
In this case , he saw a neighbor .
The next report said , `` I 'm going to go to the place , I found the advent of <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? Yes ? Yes .
I came back to the moon . I was home .
Thank you . ''
No simple .
This is great . It 's the <unk> of the digital and physical .
And it 's also a great example of the government of the government in the local collaboration .
But it 's also a great example of government as a platform .
And here 's not necessarily I mean the important definition of platform .
I 'm talking about a platform for people and help each other .
So , a citizen helped each other , but here the government had a key role .
I met the two people .
And it could be able to connected to the <unk> services of being necessary , but the neighbor is a better alternative and more effective and more effective services .
When a reaction will help you another , <unk> communities .
If we call in animals , that makes a lot of money .
One thing we have to think about the government is that it 's not the same that politics .
A lot of people , but think that one is the <unk> of the other .
And that our <unk> of government is the vote .
How many times have been able to have a political leader ? Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new leader and then we hope that the government tells our values and affect our needs , but then we do n't see changes .
That 's because the government is like a huge ocean , and politics is the dark layer of 15 .
On below it is what we call them .
And we say that word with a lot .
But it 's that researching what we do that is that we 're supposed to be that we built in our against , that another thing , and in fact we are losing the power .
People believe that politics is cured .
If we want that this institution work to be able to do that , which is going to do that the <unk> is .
Because it 's there where the real work of government .
We have to collaborate with the government .
That does the movement .
You have seen ?
It 's a group of citizens worried that have been written a very high report from <unk> pages in the answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
That 's not political policies , it 's responsible .
And so for us that we 've got to get to the government , it 's time to tell us what the world we want to make our children .
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face .
We really believe that we 're going to go to where we have to go to make the institution that can act in the name of all ?
We ca n't take the government , we need to be more effective .
The good news is that with technology is possible from the root function of the government , so that we can calculate the civil society .
There 's a generation that grew up with the Internet , and knows that it 's not so hard to be able to be <unk> , only there 's only the systems of the right way .
The average age of our members of our members is about 28 years , so I 'm going to say , I 'm a little generation of them .
This is a generation that has grown to the word , and they get that almost by sitting .
They do n't give that battle that we 've all seeing about who 's going to talk ; you 're all going to talk .
You can express their opinions in any bottom at the same time and they do it .
So when you use the problem of the government do n't care about their voices .
They 're using the hands .
They get your hands to program applications that make better to the government .
And those applications will allow the hands to improve our communities .
It may be known to you a walk , let 's put it out , it 's a <unk> line that has a <unk> inside .
Of course , we can always have to get those and a lot of people .
But these applications are like a digital <unk> , not only consumers , not only consumers that we can pay taxes and get services services .
We are more than that : we are citizens .
And we 're not going to fix the government until they do n't know the <unk> .
So I want to ask all of the way , when it 's about the important things we have to do together , all together , we 're all together , we 'll be a crowd of voices , or also be a arm of hands ?
Thank you .
This is to me a real honor .
I 've spent the most part of the time in education , we built and in the death of death .
I 've spent the biggest part of my life in communities , in projects and places where there 's a lot of despair .
And I 'll be here in TED seeing , and you 'll hear these algorithms , has a lot of energy .
One of the things I 've seen in this short time , is that TED has a identity has .
And the things you say here have impact on the world .
In times , if something comes from TED , it has a sense and a force that does n't have in another way .
I mean this because I think the identity is really important .
So here we 've seen a great role .
And I think we 've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense , but if you get them with feeling with feeling , you can have a special meaning .
A doctor can make things good , <unk> if it 's <unk> , you can make a lot more .
So I want to talk about the power of the identity .
Actually I do n't learned this in the right practice , my work .
I learned about my grandmother .
I grew up in a modern house of a <unk> family , which was my grandmother .
It was hard , it was strong , I had power .
It was the last word in a discussion in the family .
She takes a lot of <unk> in our home .
It was daughter of people who had been seen .
Their parents were in the slavery in Virginia .
She was born on the blog and their experience with slavery , the way we see the world .
She was a <unk> , but it was also a chicken .
When I was a little , and I looked at it , she came up , and I got a good .
I 'll get it so strong that I could barely breathe , and then I did it .
One or two hours later , I got back to look at , and he said , `` <unk> , I do n't feel my arms ? ''
And if I said that I do n't , I got back again , and if I said I know , I went in peace .
I had this human quality that you would have always wanted to be close from it .
The one problem is that I was 10 children .
My mother was the less of 10 .
In times , when I was going to spend a time with it , not it was not easy to be able to get their time and their attention .
My books were everywhere .
I remember when I was eight nine years ago , I woke up one morning , I went to the room , and there were back to the room , and there were all my child .
My grandmother was the other side of the room , and I looked on .
When I thought it was a game .
So I looked at , but she was very serious .
After 15 20 minutes , she turned up , I turned up the room , I was walking on the hand and said , `` You see it . The two are going to talk . ''
I remember this like yesterday .
I never forget .
He took me outside , and he said , `` You know , I 'll tell you something , but you do n't tell you something , but you ca n't say . ''
I said , `` It 's OK . ''
She said , `` Now , I 'm going to say you do n't do . ''
And then I felt , I looked at me and said , `` I want you to tell you that I 've been seeing . ''
And he said , `` I think you 're special . ''
He said , `` I think you can do it . ''
I never forget .
And then he said , `` I just want to tell me three things , <unk> . ''
I said , `` Wow , '' ''
And he said , `` The first thing I want to tell me is that I always love your mother . ''
<unk> : `` She 's my <unk> , and you 've got to be able to <unk> the <unk> . ''
As I came to my mom , I said , `` Yes , I 'm going to do . ''
And then he said , `` The second I want to tell me is that you always do the right thing if the right thing is not hard . ''
I thought and I said , `` Yes . '' I 'll do . ''
And then , finally said , `` The third thing I want to tell me is that you do n't get alcohol . ''
I was nine years ago , and I said , `` Yes , I 'm going to do . ''
I grew up in the field , in South Africa , I have a brother a year , and a sister a year .
When I was 14 15 , a day my brother came home with a couple of weeks , I do n't know where he came up , we asked my sister and to me and we went to the forest .
And we 're going to get them to do .
He took a tone of beer , he gave my sister , she took a little , and I took me to me .
I said , `` No , not . You do n't . You go , but I 'm not going to take a beer . ''
My brother said , `` We go .
I 've got to take something , your sister also .
I said , `` No . I do n't give me . ''
And then my brother looked at me .
And he said , `` What happens ?
I came up with the force , and I was born , `` Oh , you do n't be thinking about the conversation with a uncle . ''
I said , `` Why are you talking about ? ''
He said , `` Tell you to all the grandchildren who are special . ''
I was born .
I have to admit something to you .
I 'll tell you something that I probably should say .
I know that this is essential .
But I have three years ago , and I can tell you that I 've never taken up , not a <unk> .
I do n't tell you this thinking that it 's a man ; I say by the power that has the identity .
When we create the right kind of identity , we say things to the others that they do n't see sense .
We ca n't get to get things that do n't believe to do .
I think my grandmother 's going to think that all their grandchildren were special .
My grandfather had been done for the <unk> .
My course died of mental diseases with peace .
And these were the things that , in it , we 've got to stop .
Now let 's try to talk about our justice system .
This country is now very different than it was 40 years ago .
There was a lot of <unk> .
Today , there 's 80 billion .
In America , we have the biggest rate of the world .
We have seven billion people in freedom .
And this uses , in my mind , has changed our world .
In the poor communities or color , you find so much <unk> , so much in these facts .
One of every three members between the 18 and 30 years is in the prison or freedom .
In the urban <unk> of all the country , Los Angeles , blood , 70 , 20 to 60 percent of all the young young people are in prison or freedom .
Our system is not only in front of the race , also is what it 's about poverty .
In this country , we have a system that makes you a lot better if you 're rich and amazing , that if you 're poor and it 's true .
It 's not .
And it seems to make us very new .
The politics of fear , and you do n't believe that these are not problems .
We 're born .
It seems interesting .
We 're looking at our work .
In my state , in Alabama , so as in other states , you 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a explosion .
Now , in Alabama , the eight percent of the American population has lost the right to the vote .
And if we put it to the next 10 years , the human level of rights power will be as well as I was before the law 's law .
We have this amazing amazing .
I gave children .
Many of my customers are very young .
The United States is the only country in the world where he turned to young children to die in prison .
We have in this country for children , not possibility to get it .
Now , we 're going to have a process of some .
The only country in the world .
Let 's look at people in the death .
This issue of death is interesting .
Now , in a sense , you 've got to think that the end question is , people are going to die by the <unk> <unk> ?
A very important question .
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity .
There 's another way of seeing , it 's not about to decide if people are going to die by the <unk> crimes , but , if we 're able to fight .
This is interesting .
The death of death in the United States is going to play .
In every nine of nine people , it has shown a place that is because it 's <unk> , and from the death of death .
One rate of mistake , amazing , a <unk> of every nine .
This is interesting .
In Cambridge , you could n't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to say .
But some of some way we get the problem .
It 's not our problem .
It 's not our electricity .
It 's not our fight .
I 'm talking about these things .
I 'm talking about death , and this issue of this issue .
It 's interesting that in my groups with students about history .
I 'm going to talk about terrorism , the time that started at the end of the <unk> , and it was starting to the World War .
Now , we do n't know a lot of this .
But for the black Americans in this country , it was a little bit of the <unk> .
In a lot of communities people were afraid to be <unk> .
I was worried about it .
And the threat of the branches was what they brought their lives .
Now , there are the biggest people who come up and tell me , `` Mr. Station , you know , `` Mr. Station , you know , I 'll tell people to say that in our story , we do with the first time , after the <unk> . ''
I 'm going to tell you , `` No . No .
The era of terrorism was born , obviously , and decades , and decades , and decades of <unk> .
In this country , we have a dynamic why we do n't like to talk about our problems .
We do n't like to talk about our story .
And it 's why we do n't understand the meaning of what we 've done .
All of the time we 've got a few with others .
We were able to create tensions and conflict .
We 're going to talk about a little job . I think it 's because we 're not willing to go back with a process of truth .
In South South South Africa , the people who would n't have to make the <unk> , without a commitment with the truth and the processor .
In Rwanda , still before the genocide had this commitment , but in this country we do n't have .
I was in Germany to give you about the death of death .
It was fascinating because one of the teachers have couple after my presentation and said , `` You know , `` You know , `` You know that it 's good key to hear what you say . ''
<unk> : `` We do n't have death in Germany in Germany .
You can never see it here . ''
The room was born in silence and a lady said , `` There 's no way that with our story , we can never get in the systematic death of humans .
It would be glad that we were , let 's say , and let 's stop , we put them to play people . ''
<unk> about this .
How do we teach us in a world where a nation like Germany , you get to people , especially if they were in their parents ?
We could n't know it .
It would be sick .
And yet , there is this disconnect .
I think our identity is in danger .
If you do n't care about these things so hard , things and wonderful things are , but it 's not .
We love innovation .
You know , the technology . The creativity .
We love entertainment .
But you know , those means are <unk> by suffering , the abuse , the <unk> , the <unk> .
In my mind , it 's necessary to integrate both things .
We 'll talk about the need to have more hope , more commitment , more than the basic challenges of the life of this complex world .
I think that , I think that 's going to go back and talking about the poor , the <unk> , which you never get to TED .
You think of them is , in a way , something that 's inside our being .
It 's true that we have to believe in things we do n't seen .
So , we are , because of being so rational , so we get with the intellectual .
And with innovation , with creativity . The development is not just from the brain ideas .
These things come from <unk> , also by the heart of the heart .
This connection of the mind with the heart is what we take us to look at it , not just in the brilliant , but also in the dark , but also it .
I got a <unk> , the big leader , talking about this .
He said , `` When we were in Europe , it 's the smile , we get all the kind of things , but particularly what we needed it was hope , we do n't get in the spirit , a will be able to be involved in places , and it will be tired . ''
Well , that <unk> for the spirit is still in the heart of what I think , which still in communities like TED , it 's got to stop .
There 's not no protection with technology and design , which allows us to be really humans if we do n't take the attention to poverty to poverty , to the appearance , to poverty , to the poverty , to the poverty .
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts is a lot more than if we look at these things .
We go back to <unk> .
I had the great privilege , it 's a very young lawyer , I 'll know it 's a very young .
These women had just to talk about .
And yet , the lady <unk> me , to tell me , `` <unk> , it comes the lady , we 're going to take it to try to talk .
Do you want to come and do ? ''
I said , `` Yes . I know . ''
So she said , `` Well , and what do you do ? ''
I said , `` <unk> . ''
So , I was , and just said .
It was very <unk> , very <unk> .
And in a single time , I was listening to these ladies , and then after a couple of hours , the advice was going to come back to me and said , `` Now , I 'm going to tell me , you know , `` Now , <unk> , tell me it 's that idea of justice justice .
You know what you 're trying to do . ''
And I started to give you my speech .
I said , `` Well , we 're trying to ask the alphabet .
We try to help you that they have been lost .
We 're trying to be able to be able to take them , and the minerals in the Congo of justice justice .
We 're trying to end up with the course of life , without freedom for children .
We try to do something about death .
We 're trying to reduce the population in education .
We 're trying to end up with a huge <unk> . ''
I 'll tell you all my best speech , and I looked at me , and he said , `` Let me go back . ''
And he said , `` <unk> , '' ''
In that moment , Mr. <unk> , I put the finger in the face and said , `` It 's why you have to be very , but very happy . ''
I think that actually , the TED community has to be a lot of <unk> .
We have to find the way to make those challenges , those problems , that suffering .
Because eventually the humanity is about compassion for others .
I 've learned some simple things in my work .
I 've been trained in things .
I 've got to understand and to believe that each of us is the worst we 've done .
I think that 's true for all the world in the planet .
I 'm convinced that if somebody says a guy , it 's not because it 's a <unk> .
I 'm sure if someone would take something that does n't happen , it 's not that it 's one .
Even , if somebody kills another , not that it 's a <unk> .
So , I think there 's a basic dignity in people who should be taken by the law .
I also think that in many parts of this country , and yet , in many parts of the world , the opposite of the world is not the wealth .
So it 's not .
I actually think about many parts the opposite of poverty is justice .
And finally , I think , if it 's very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , very <unk> , you do n't know us by our technology , by our designs , not by our intellectual capacity or rational capacity .
At the end of the character , the character of a society , not by the way as they try to the rich , powerful and Germany , but by the way as they treat the poor , they get them .
Because it 's in this context as we started to understand important issues about what we are .
Now , I 'm sorry to end up with a story .
Sometimes I do too much force .
<unk> , like all .
Sometimes those ideas are more than the <unk> of a important way .
I 've been able to go to these kids who have been a lot of a lot of .
I 'm going to school , and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years ago , who have been <unk> for you as well .
And I wanted to think , how can be ?
How can a answer to put someone in which is not ?
The answer is <unk> as a adult , but I see a child .
A very late night , I was born thinking about -- my God , if you can lose you , you can be able to turn in something that you 're not , but they have to have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Yes , <unk> , the shadow has been able to make it .
You need to ask something of that .
As it was very late , I could n't think about it , but I started to work in a <unk> .
I had a few years ago , a little , white , black , black , black .
I started to work in the <unk> , with a <unk> who said , `` You know , I 'm going to say , `` You know , I 'm going to say , `` You know , I 'm going to say , `` You know , I 'm going to say , `` You know , I 'm going to say , `` You know , I 'll
In the <unk> , I put that there had been behavior , in the Netherlands , in the police behavior and in the process .
There was a line on how in this country is there , but all a lack of everything .
At the next morning , I woke up thinking that that <unk> <unk> would be a dream , or I actually wrote it ?
To my horror , not only the <unk> , but I had sent to the <unk> .
I got a few months ago , I 've got to start .
And I finally decided , `` God , I have to go to the <unk> by this case .
I got back to the car , and I felt very excited about it .
I was in the car at the <unk> .
I thought that this would be very hard .
Finally , I looked at the car . Go at the front .
I was looking at the stairs when I found with a black black man ; it was the <unk> of <unk> .
When I saw me , I came up and said , `` Who is you ? ''
I said , `` I 'm a lawyer . '' He said , `` This is you . '' He said I know .
So , I 've got to teach me , and I 'll take it .
And I 'll take me in the ear .
He said , `` I 'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you what that was <unk> .
Now , that 's very deeply with my identity , with my identity with the ability that we all have to make the community with a vision of hope .
Well , I came to the <unk> room .
When I put it , the shadow I saw me .
And he said , `` Mr. Venter , you 've wrote this smile ? ''
I said , `` Yes ! I was . ''
People started going to get . They were all of them .
I was the one that had been written those .
They have the Germans , they get the <unk> .
As soon , I do n't know how , the room was full of people , all of people because we talked about , because we talked about , because we talked about poverty , because we talked about inequality .
And with the <unk> of the eye , I met to see the painting I was and came up .
Let 's look at the window and you 'll hear all that <unk> .
I 'll walk back to here and for there .
Finally , this old black , with a face of concern , I walked in the room and I was born behind me , almost in the table table .
A lot of a few minutes later , the shadow would take a bird .
For the end of the head of the <unk> came up because I was born , because I had gone in the room .
It 's got up on the old color .
And he said , `` What do you do in the room room ? ''
And the old black came back to a foot , I looked at me to me , and he said , `` I went to this room room to tell this young , and he said , `` I 'm going to go to this young room to tell you this guy in the goal . ''
I 've come to TED , because I think of a lot of you , and I think a lot of you understand that the moral matrix of the universe is very big , but it 's going to affect justice .
We ca n't be human humans , if we do n't know for human rights and in dignity .
What our survival is moving to the other .
And that our perspective of technology , design , entertainment and creativity you have to be able to lose the <unk> , and they have justice and justice .
And by all of all , to those of the way that they share this , I just want to tell you to tell you that you get the view in the goal with it .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : You 've got to hear and see a good desire of the audience , from this community , to help something .
Something that 's not a step . What can we do ?
<unk> : There 's a few opportunities .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there 's a <unk> this spring in which it 's going to do a effort to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
For example , here in California , you 're going to spend billion dollars in the death of death , in the next five years .
And even though this , the 45 percent of the <unk> cases do n't be able to be <unk> .
90 percent of the nurses do n't get anything .
Here 's a chance of change .
This <unk> is going to take you to take these to do that the law , to security .
I think there 's a very high opportunity .
CA : There 's there there have been a huge <unk> in the U.S. in the last three decades .
A part of the explanation , it tells you that you have to see with the biggest rate of them .
What would you say that it is so ?
<unk> : It 's actually , the <unk> rate has been relatively relatively stable .
The big growth in the epidemic in this country is not by coral .
It 's by the wrong war against drugs .
It 's why it comes to that the dramatic increase in the American population .
And we let me convince you by the advent of inspiration .
We have three cause of legal causes to take the people to generate , and therefore a car , for small crimes against the property , in place to make those resources to fight .
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less .
I mean that our philosophy is not done by no one .
I think that that 's what that 's the imperative that has to change .
CA : <unk> , you know , you 've heard it today today .
You 're very happy .
Thank you very much to have to come to TED . Thank you .
And it 's going to go , they 're going to get the threats for death .
Two two : <unk> in Somalia .
Two four : You know , <unk> . five : <unk> <unk> .
He was six : social <unk> .
About eight : <unk> .
A lot of <unk> : He was going to fight .
Man , <unk> . You 'll get the end of us . Egypt .
Man : No .
Oh , God !
I looked at me , these are only some of the advice that I got in the past six months , <unk> could be in the past six days or in the past six years .
The idea is that the media media is that the negative media , because our minds will be attention .
And that 's not a very good reason .
In every second of every day , our senses are going to get a lot of data that probably the brain can process .
And as there 's nothing more than survive , the first end of all of those data is a old part of the British lobe called 2030 .
The amygdala is our detector , the power of danger .
<unk> , and it 's all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us .
So that 's why one of a <unk> of stories to look at the negative .
So that number of the press , `` If there 's blood , it 's not .
And because that all of the digital devices would give us bad news the seven days of the week , 24 hours to the day , it 's not to tell you that we do .
I do n't feel that people think the world 's going to bad in worse .
But maybe it 's not like this .
Maybe , in change , what is really happening is that we got to get it .
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces , it 's known as a way we have the potential to create a new world in the next three decades .
I 'm not saying that we do n't have our good problems : climate change , the species of species , the <unk> of water and energy .
As human beings are very good for <unk> the problems , and the long , we 've got with them .
Let 's take it in the last century to see where we go .
In the last hundred years , the average of life has more than grow , the average income per capita per capita per capita has changed everywhere .
Second mortality has gone to 10 times .
Also , the cost of food , the cost of food , and the communication and communication , it has gone from 10 to 1,000 times .
I showed us that we are living the most dominant time from the story of humanity .
And Charles is that the world of 25 percent over 25 percent in the last 60 years .
We 're really living a extraordinary time .
Many people .
And we 're going to go back to survive every time .
In fact , we get the meaning of poverty .
Think here , today in the U.S. , a great part of people who live under the line of poverty have electricity , water , Asia , and cars , and cars .
The <unk> <unk> of the past century , the <unk> of the planet , you would never have a bit like a bit of such .
And I 'll get a lot of this is technology , and you get it , their growth .
So my good friend Ray told you that any tool that <unk> in technology of the information would be seen in this curve , the president of death , and it takes the performance of the price in about six to 24 months .
So , that 's why the cell , you have in your pocket is a million times more cheap , and sometimes more fast than a engineer of the 1970s .
Now look at this curve .
It 's Law 's Law for the last hundred years .
I want you to look at two things in this curve .
First , the little thing that is -- in good and bad times , in the war and in the peace , in wealth , in depression .
It 's the <unk> of computers used to build computers .
It 's not going to go into none of the big challenges .
And even though it 's <unk> in a law to the left , it 's true .
The growth rate of technology is in all more fast .
And in this curve , to <unk> from Moore 's Law , there 's a series of incredibly powerful technologies that we do .
The communication in the cloud , which my friends 's friends call simple , sensors and networks , and networks , which is a 3D capacity and their ability to rethink production in all the planet , biology biology , and the food , and the food , and the food , and the food , and the food , and the food .
I mean , how many of you saw the sitting in `` `` Oh , I mean , `` How many of the James ?
It was a lot .
I 'm going to go in the <unk> the best headline who would have .
And I loved it this : `` We call it out of humans . ''
Man is not a easy game .
You know , with the human language .
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for all in the cell .
A thousand years ago , here in TED , you 've heard , and I 've launched a new university called <unk> .
We teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
And every year we 've got to get a company , or a product or a product or service , which can affect us the lives of a billion people in a decade .
Now think about that , the fact that a group of students today , it can be able to visualize life billion people .
So 30 years that would have <unk> <unk> .
We can think about a <unk> <unk> that they 've already done .
When I think , in order , it does n't mean to create life for each other of the planet ; it 's about to create a life of the possible .
It 's about how to take that , and it 's going to take that .
You can see , the cows is contextual and technology is a force that keeps resources .
I 'll give you a example .
And it 's a story of Yemen 's story of <unk> .
He 's the kind of left .
I brought the king of <unk> .
And the <unk> camp , and the same Kelly , and the same statistic , with <unk> .
But the king of <unk> , I was born with <unk> .
You can see , the competition was the more efficient <unk> of the planet ; it was more than the river and the Taliban .
And so that 's why the tip of the <unk> of Washington is from <unk> .
You can see , if the entertainment is , even though the entertainment is about the mass of the Earth , it does n't come as a <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to be able for oxygen and <unk> .
But then he got the <unk> , and he made the <unk> and made it as cheap that we use it as if it was <unk> .
I 'll get this analogy to the future .
Let 's think about the power of energy .
Ladies and gentlemen , we 're in a planet , by the most energy times more energy that we use in a year .
They go to the 16 <unk> of energy every minutes .
It 's not about reasonable , but we 'll have .
And there 's good news .
This year , for the first time , the cost of the solar energy in India is 50 percent than the dodo of the advent of <unk> is 50 percent .
The cost of energy energy 50 percent last year .
One month , the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade of the decade , in the U.S. parts of the United States , international electricity will be six cents the <unk> per hour with 15 cents a national .
And if we have new energy also have new water .
Let 's talk about the wars for the water .
Let 's remember when you 've got to put the spaceship space in the Earth , in South , then then happened ?
<unk> a famous picture . How was called ?
`` You know , `` You know , `` You know , `` You 've got a blue . ''
Because we live in a planet of water .
We live in a planet in 70 percent for water .
Yes , the <unk> percent is water water , the two percent is ice , and we would be able to be able to be through the water percent of the planet , but also here 's a hope .
It 's a available technology not in 10 20 years , but right now .
It comes up , the <unk> .
In a conversation , in a conversation , one of the <unk> of the <unk> -- I 'd like to share with you with you , he gave me permission to do it -- their technology called <unk> <unk> , the <unk> called <unk> <unk> .
It 's able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the day of any <unk> <unk> , water water , a <unk> for less .
The president of Coca-Cola , I 'm going to do a important test test of these units in the developing world .
If that comes up well , and I 've got to put it in the way that I 'll be , Coca-Cola 's what we 'll be , Coca-Cola 's what we get up in the planet in the planet .
This is a innovation innovation for this technology that today exists .
And we 've seen in the mobile phones .
God , my God , we 're going to go to 70 percent of the cell in the world in the world in the late developing world .
Think about it , that 's <unk> , it 's <unk> has better communication cell in Kenya , which the president of Kenya that the president of 25 years .
And , I 'm going to tell you with a smart phone , has access to more knowledge and information that the president was 15 years ago .
And it lives in a new amount of information and communication that nobody could have been able to do .
They 're going to say that , the things that you have , and I 've got hundreds of tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> , video , images , images , images , images , images , images , <unk> , <unk> technology , and they 've got to lose value value .
Maybe the best come up when it 's going to be in health applications .
The month last month , I had the pleasure of <unk> with the <unk> Foundation , something called the Nobel <unk> <unk> , 10 billion dollars .
We 're responsible to the conditions of the world for these technologies in a cell device with the people who talk , and because they have to be able to be able to be able to see it , you can see it , you can lose blood .
To win it has to do better than a medical team .
Imagine this device in the middle world in the developing world in which there are no doctors , where the result of us is about 25 percent and there 's 50 percent of health workers .
When this device <unk> a virus virus , or DNA that does n't know , called the health , and , in the first place , to prevent it on the pandemic .
But this is the biggest force of produce a new world .
I call a billion dollars in the increase .
The white lines of here are the population .
We 've been able to go back from the seven billion .
On the way , the best protection against biological explosion is to be able to the world of education and health .
In 2010 , we had less about two billion people in line , connected .
To 2020 , spend about two billion than five billion users of the Internet .
Now three billion minds never heard before the global conversation .
What do you want these people ?
What else ?
And in a place of a economic gas , we have the most economic economies of history .
These people represent tens of billion dollars in the global economy .
And it 's <unk> in the <unk> , of a better education with the National Academy , and because of the use of the symptoms in 3D , and the computer use in the cloud is more expensive than never before .
What can you give us three billion members of the humanity , healthy , and expensive ?
What about some voices never before ?
What if you give you to the rules , where they are , a voice to be thinking and can be able to act for the first time ?
What are these three billion ?
And if you 're to visualize it ?
Something that I learned with the Nobel Prize is that young teams , put by their passion with a goal of course , you can make things extraordinary ; things that before you could only do the big support and governments .
I 'm going to end up with a story that I really forget .
There 's a program that maybe some of you know .
It 's called <unk> .
<unk> in the University of Washington , in Seattle .
It 's a game in the people who can take a sequence of acids and figure out the way that 's using the protein .
They do n't know the structure and the way .
It 's something very important in the medical research .
And , until it , it was a problem problem .
They 've done with this young teachers , between others .
And then hundreds of thousands of people , and started it .
And you 've shown that today , the <unk> of human patterns is better than the best computers .
Ladies and gentlemen , what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges of the planet .
We have the tools with this economic technology .
We have the passion of the <unk> .
We have the capital of <unk> .
And we have three billion minds that we 've got to work in the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do .
We have in front of extraordinary decades .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about a very small idea .
The <unk> of the point .
And as the idea can be seen in a minute , before I 'll give you three examples to do time .
The first story is about Dr. Darwin , one of my heroes .
He was here , as you know .
Maybe you think that I 'm born , but it was n't like this .
They actually take fish .
And he looked at one of them as much . ''
It was the fish .
It 's going to go back to the 1970s .
Now , the fish is in the <unk> <unk> .
But we 've heard this story many times , in front and other places , so that 's not a special thing .
But the case is we still come to the garden .
We do n't think that are <unk> .
They 're still saying you 're going on .
So what happens here ?
Now , the second story , we also explain another concept : the <unk> of it .
Because I was sitting there , I grew up , I grew up a <unk> in Africa .
I was there because I grew in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa .
I thought I could <unk> .
I got a lot with the sun , and I was convinced that I was not from there .
This is my first exhibition to the sun .
He was surrounded from weeks , and , as you can see , from a few thirds .
There was <unk> from about 20 minutes , the <unk> <unk> .
And the flow of this would be very much , and it comes up by a good moment , so that 's the most of the average in Ghana .
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had gone from half .
<unk> five minutes .
It 's a genetic system .
There was no fish .
In the way , they were still happy .
And the fish still were happy to be there .
Or it 's , nothing to changed , but everything has changed .
My third story is that I went on in the introduction of the <unk> of Turkey in Southern Asia .
In the 1970s , I started in the <unk> of <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects .
The developing development was taken up to the countries that they had to give you to the countries that they had to give you a lot of notes .
And this boat , pretty successful , I called the <unk> <unk> .
I went back to come back in him , and we made studies in the South Sea of China , and , everywhere , in the Sea Sea .
And what there would happen was something <unk> .
<unk> , right now , the bottom of the sea .
The 90 percent of what we were born were diagnosed , other animals who are in the bottom .
And most of the fish are deeply <unk> about a lot of reality , which is that they are all fish of coral reef .
In short , the bottom of the sea came to the neighborhood , and then it was done .
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
In a year , you have a study , and then it begins the commercial mass .
The bottom is going to be a nuclear rate of coral coral , in this case , to be a <unk> .
This is a dead man .
They do n't get them . He 's because they were dead .
I got a living time .
I still was not <unk> .
So they wanted to argue because it was a good food .
This mountain mountain is what they get the notes every time you 're going to a area in which they 've never all fish .
But there 's not a novel .
We put the world , but we do n't remember it .
<unk> the point of course , the new level , without remember what was there .
If you do this is something like this .
In the axis and we have things good : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the <unk> of water .
And that changes with time . It 's because people do things with it .
Every generation to use the images at the beginning of their conscious life as a normal life , and they cut it back .
The difference is that they feel the loss .
But they do n't make the loss that happened before .
You can analyze the <unk> of changes .
And at the end of the end , they 're going to get it .
And that , in great as we want to do now .
We want to keep things that are not , or they 're not what they were .
But you should think that this problem is to people when the societies are able to share animals without knowing what they 've done to know what they 've done .
Because obviously , obviously , a animal that 's very much , before you 're going on , it 's a little bit .
You do n't know animals .
You know , you lose animals .
Now , if you do n't know as a great loss .
With the time , we 're involved in the big animals , and in a big size of great fish .
They get a little bit of them because the Germans .
With the time , it 's a few fish , but we think that that 's the point of sleep .
And the question is , why does this ?
Well , because we do n't know it was different .
In fact , a lot of people , scientists , which was very different .
And they 'll do it because the evidence was not from the way that they would have to have the evidence .
Now , for example , the invention that some of them , like a <unk> , and maybe I looked at a lot of fish in this area ca n't be used or , so they do n't use the scientists of the fish , because it 's not . ''
So , we have a situation where people do n't know the past , even though we live in the past societies , because they do n't feel in the sources of the past .
And there 's a huge role that can be able to get a huge area area .
Because with the urban areas , we actually take the past .
And the past , the past that people ca n't think , because the point of course has gone up and it 's very dangerous .
That 's for people that you can see a <unk> area , and you can benefit from the vision that tells us , which allows you to put their point of sleep .
And what happens with people who ca n't do it , because they do n't have access , like people in the West , for example ?
I think there 's the arts and the film may be able to show the vacuum . The simulation .
So this is a simulation of the sadness Station .
A lot of time , there were a lot of <unk> in the spinal cord , 300 years ago .
And you have noticed that the shadows and the <unk> are like <unk> . ''
And if you think about `` Hey , '' if you think about what people would have to talk about the movie , I 'll talk about the story of <unk> , why do you do with the images ?
Because I had something that , in a sense , you have lost .
So , I was why my appearance , the only thing to give it , it 's going to ask it , to do `` Yes , '' under the water .
Thank you very much .
Hi . I 'm Kevin <unk> , the <unk> of the YouTube , and I look at videos from YouTube in a professional way .
It 's true .
So now today you 'll see why the videos are doing , and what is that .
We all want to be stars : zeros , 45 , it -- when I was more young , that seems very , very hard .
But now today the video 's video makes any of us , or of our actions , it comes up in a part of our global culture .
You can actually do famous in the Internet in a <unk> .
It 's going to go back to a short hours of a video hours .
And that , of those , just a little percentage of color , you get a lot of <unk> , you get a lot of <unk> and make a cultural <unk> .
How happens ?
Now , three things : <unk> , communities , communities and critical .
Well , let 's start .
<unk> <unk> : Oh , God , God , God .
God !
Wow !
<unk> , <unk> !
RG : The year year , <unk> <unk> this video of his house in the National National National Park .
In 2010 , it was seen 23 billion times .
This graph shows the <unk> in the Grand Bank .
They do n't talk to do a sexual video .
I just wanted to share a comet , you 'll get you .
That 's what you do if it 's called <unk> <unk> .
And there were a lot of videos of nature .
This video was born in January .
So , what happened here ?
It was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> this <unk> that <unk> the video to the catalyst .
The political sector like <unk> and interesting things and the <unk> to a larger public .
Let 's say , `` It 's late , 2001 , I 've got to start the shoulder . They all want to get the end of a week , the end of week .
`` <unk> . ''
We saw nearly 200 billion times this year .
This graph shows the often use .
At the same thing that 's going to go . ''
So , what happened this day ?
Well , it was late , it 's true .
And if you ask all of those other men , they 're also born .
But , what happened this day , this summer in particular ?
Well , I took a <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it .
Michael Mandela , <unk> <unk> , was one of the first people in making a joke about the video .
But what the important thing is that a person or a group of <unk> , a point of view , and they share it with a larger public public process .
So , this community of people who share this great big joke , then start to talk about that and to do things .
And now there 's 10 <unk> from `` <unk> '' in YouTube .
Just just in the first seven days , there was a novel for each other days .
A difference of the entertainment century of the 20th century , this leads to us is our way to be part of the phenomenon of <unk> , or doing something new with it .
`` You 'll say , '' is a animation with a <unk> music .
It 's like , that 's everything .
This year you saw about 50 billion times .
And if you think that 's amazing , you know there 's a version of three hours that has seen four billion times .
And so I saw this video .
And there 's cats you saw in other temperature to see the video .
But what 's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> .
There was <unk> .
Somebody made a version of the old .
And then they made international made .
Suddenly , we got a whole community community that made it to be a joke to something that we can all form part .
Because today , it 's not just familiar , we put it .
Who could have suggesting something like ?
Who could be able to be able to be able to go out , `` You 'll go back , '' or the <unk> or `` <unk> ? ''
What does it could have been written that I 'm going to do this situation ?
In a world in the world , you get two days of video for minute , only the only thing , and it 's only the only thing , and there 's only the thing that these things have done .
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a kind of kind of <unk> against the <unk> in New York , I 'll give you very interested .
<unk> <unk> : I 'm going to be able to make the <unk> , but often there are often obstacles that you get a lot of <unk> by <unk> .
RG : Thank you to the point of surprise and their humor , Thomas <unk> , I had been able to have five billion you , and they put their idea .
That 's why this approach is going to all the new thing we do .
And this is all about a great question .
<unk> <unk> : What does this mean ?
<unk> .
RG : What does this mean ?
The economic communities , communities creative communities , it 's completely unexpected , are features of a new kind of media , which we 've all have access and it 's the audience that we 've all have access and it 's the audience that we do .
And as I said before , one of the <unk> of the world , I 'll go up , and he started to YouTube .
They do n't take permission to express their ideas .
Now we are all a little bit of our <unk> culture .
These are not the features of the old media , they 're only the media of the right media , but it 's going to get the entertainment of the future .
Thank you .
This is not a story .
It 's a puzzle that still is there .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man took the work of a life .
It 's a poet , a <unk> , a man whose whole life had been done in the same single unit and freedom of his country .
And then , as the <unk> come in <unk> , because their life come on the fact that his life had been totally in bad .
The words , for so friends , they 're going to get it .
It 's <unk> in silence .
He would get it on the story .
He 's my grandfather .
I never met .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother would never forget their story .
My task was not going to leave that , and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to come from <unk> , but the <unk> .
And the next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the 1970s , it 's going down to the sea .
My mother , <unk> , I had so 18 years when his father died , and a <unk> <unk> and two children .
To her , life had been able to try to a task , the one of his family and a new life in Australia .
It was known for her that I could n't do it .
And then after one of one of four years that needs fiction , a boat goes down to the sea sea , and it 's going to go up .
They all were all the risks .
The biggest fear were the shadows , the Mall and death .
As the most of the adults , my mother had been a <unk> .
If you get us , I first looked at my sister and me , and then she and then her grandmother .
My first memories are from that boat , the constant rate of the engine , the <unk> in every wave , and the <unk> horizon and empty .
I do n't remember the shadows that came from several times , but they were able to draw with the <unk> of men in our boat , or the death , and they did n't try to go back for six hours .
But I know , I know the lights of the platform in front of Malaysia , and the young man who came up and died , the journey was too for him , and the first apple I was too for him .
No apple had after the same thing .
Then of three months in a <unk> field , <unk> in <unk> .
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations to make a new life together .
We set up in <unk> , a little bit of <unk> , whose population is taken from immigrants .
A difference from the middle of a half class , which is the existence of me , in <unk> , no sense of the right .
And what they come from the shops of the world were the rest of the world .
And the <unk> of English <unk> is between people who had a thing in common : they were starting again .
My mother worked in income , then in a line of cars , working six days , you 'll go to go .
And so , I found time to study English and get a signal in the <unk> .
We were poor .
They were all the dollars , and you 'll get a lot in English and mathematics , not if you get it out of what we 'll be able to take it , but they often was a new clothes .
Two pieces of <unk> for school , you can get the holes of the other .
It 's a school uniform to the jury , because I had to go back six years .
And there were a little bit and <unk> on the `` eyes <unk> , '' and some of them , you go home . ''
On home , where ?
Something in me .
I was called it , and a voice who said , `` I 'm going to <unk> . ''
My mother , my sister , and I was <unk> in the same bed .
My mother was reacting every night , but we 'll get it on our day and the British movements of our grandmother in the house .
My mother would come down , all of the boat .
And my task was going to be on until their muscles can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it .
She turned a store of computers , then I had to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> and put another business .
And the women came up with their stories about men who could n't do the transition , let me and <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they 're young and boys .
They get it up , and they die .
And they were created in trouble .
I grew up in the skull .
In one , it was the <unk> student , you know with what I 'm going from me .
In the other , I was interested in life , <unk> <unk> by violence , the <unk> of drugs , and the isolation .
But a lot of sleep through the years .
And for that work , when I was my last year of me , I was invited the young of the year .
And I went out of a piece of the puzzle , but their oceans do n't get .
And so , I 'm going to go back to <unk> <unk> , it was right now , music and social engineering , I tried to talk about places that I 've never heard about , and in home who 's never seen .
I did n't know the protocols .
I did n't know how to use them .
I did n't know how to talk about wine .
I did n't know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to go to the color and the lifestyle of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a mother , a mother , and two , a mother and two , the day as they did it by almost 20 years ago , <unk> on the day of each one .
And I said to my mom who could n't do it .
I realized I was now the same age that she had when she had when we put it to the boat .
The `` No , '' had never been a option .
`` Well , '' '' I said , `` We do n't be what they do n't . ''
So I talked about <unk> and education , and the <unk> to the elbow and the <unk> .
And the most frankly talked about , more it was <unk> to talk .
I met people from all of the life of life , many of them doing what I loved , living in the border of the possible .
And if I ended up my uncle , I realized I could n't get in a career career .
I had to have another piece of the puzzle .
And I realized the same time that 's good to be a <unk> , a half , again in the scene -- and not only that it 's so well , but that 's something about what I 'll be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
Because it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to accept the <unk> of your progress .
I made the enough steps out of my comfort area to know that , I know , that the world 's going to know , that the world 's going to go , but not in the way we hope .
<unk> that they had n't been <unk> were <unk> .
There was a energy there , a reputation , a fiber of creativity , and the magic .
So I started my intuition .
I 'm going to get a little group of people for people who would say , `` You ca n't happen . ''
For a year we did n't have a pencil .
At the end of every day , he made a giant <unk> , we did all share .
<unk> to the night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant , and we open it .
I took the decision to teach the U.S. .
Then of a only journey .
My couple again .
Three few months later I had to be able to , and the adventure was born .
I had to end , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up in a time in which the <unk> was the social , and the local <unk> was the person who works .
Life did n't work for centuries .
Their father died after she was born .
The mother was used .
And the 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother gave him .
They were trying to support her husband , made a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause it up , and a lot of <unk> <unk> when I saw .
You ca n't have been going to be wrong .
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in a hotel when she died , a thousand miles , in front .
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw the other side .
I learned that I had to come to stop .
My mother called minutes later .
I was born later , we went to a <unk> temple in <unk> , and then we sat around their colleagues .
We have stories and we do n't do that .
At the night , the night came up and said that I had to close to the advice .
My mother asked us that <unk> his hand .
I asked to her , `` Why your hand is hot , and the rest of the body , so well ? ''
`` Because you have taken his hand from the morning , '' he said .
`` Do n't have <unk> . ''
If there 's a cell in our family , that goes through women .
Now , because we were , and how life would have us , we can now see that men who have come to the men who would have come to our lives .
It would have <unk> <unk> .
Now I want to have my children , and I ask me about the boat .
Who could I want that to know ?
But yet , I 'm afraid to art .
And I can give you a place in their lives , it 's a little bit in every species , the <unk> rate of the engine , the original floor that does n't explain anything ?
I do n't know .
But if you could give you , and you look at them , it would be .
<unk> <unk> , and also the mother 's mother is today , in the fourth or free line .
My story begins in <unk> about two years .
I was in the desert , under the Himalayas , with the <unk> sky , with the <unk> <unk> .
We were a little bit of how nothing has changed from the time of the ancient <unk> , `` The <unk> . ''
In those days , when we wanted to travel to <unk> , and <unk> the sky .
Now we do it with crime .
And in that then when you get , the big dictionary bread , I had to go up , and he had a comet and with a <unk> to the floor , they get water .
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines .
The conclusion that we had was that the machine had taken to the magic .
And that 's a lot of me .
Every time I felt a little bit of <unk> .
I 'm going to tell you this idea of the ability to listen and see a smile if I did n't have the camera , if I could n't tell my friends .
I seemed that the technology had to give the magic , not it .
My mom my grandfather gave me their <unk> <unk> .
And this piece of 50 years ago was for my most magic thing .
It became a <unk> door to a full of images , and <unk> and <unk> in my imagination .
I had the feeling of the mobile phones , the <unk> and the cameras prevent it .
<unk> our inspiration .
And so I 've got to me , I put it to this digital world to see how to use it to create magic , in time to make it .
<unk> books from the 16 years .
And so when I saw the iPad , I saw a device that we fly to connect the price of the whole world .
You can know how to take the book .
Where are we .
They brought the text with the image , the <unk> , the sound , the sound and the love .
The country becomes more <unk> .
But so , for what does it mean ?
I 'm going to go from <unk> <unk> , a <unk> application .
He says , `` It 's your fingers on every light . ''
And so , he said , `` This box is going to -- '' I 'm sorry my name .
And so I 'll go back a character of the book .
In a few moments , I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where you live .
My child in all of these possibilities .
I 've talked a lot of magic .
And I do n't mean , and it 's the magic of the childhood , to those ideas who were young children .
On some reason , cows in a temple , I always come up to me .
So , for here , we have to get the iPad to take the steel .
And , of truth , they lose your road in the book .
Another idea that I was a few girl that was a <unk> galaxy in a <unk> .
So here , every book , and every single world , in one of the world that I looked at this magic device , inside the device .
And this is a map .
In all of the book book always have been maps but have been maps , but have been maps .
This is a map that moves , <unk> , and you get it up for the rest of the book .
In certain of the book that 's also known .
I 'm going to go back .
Now , a very important thing for me to me is to create the age of course , and then it .
These of here are the <unk> .
We 've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> , but how many people were from India , you know their young young young time ?
These poor <unk> have been built in the cameras cameras for millennia , in a old and <unk> book .
That 's why we 're trying to go back in a little child .
In a story that 's about issues like the environmental crisis .
And , talking about the environmental crisis , one of the world of the past 10 years has been that children have been born , etc. , they do n't come to the outside world .
But now with the mobile technology we can take our children to the natural world with their technology .
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure in which there is to come back to the outside , take the camera or the iPad , and including images of different objects .
A child , I had a lot of pieces : <unk> , <unk> , cows and cows .
The reason they do n't do it .
So to reclaim this project of childhood , you have to go and , in a chapter , <unk> a picture of one , and then <unk> .
In another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex , and then they 're going on .
This is a digital collection of pictures that then you can put in the Web .
A child from London is a picture of a ghost , and he says , `` Oh , today I saw a bit . ''
A child in India says , `` Now , I saw a monkey . ''
And it shows this sort of social network in a collection of the digital pictures that have been going to go .
In the <unk> of the connection between the magic , Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities .
In the next book , you 've got a interaction in which one comes up with the iPad , and the video is going to be able to be able to look at a group of <unk> , which are on the plants of the house .
In a point of the screen is full of the screen .
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book .
Let 's go into a world in the forces of nature , and the magic , and the magic and technology is going to get back to another .
<unk> the energy energy .
We 're going to go back to our children , and we 're going to the same world and to that magic , happy and love and love and love .
Thank you .
I want to talk to talk about why a lot of <unk> projects .
And I think , really , that the most important thing about that is we let 's listen to the patients .
And one of the things we did in the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listen .
And it 's not from a very scientific way , she took a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients , family and hear : What happens ? ''
`` How can we do ?
And we try to think , that this is one of the biggest problems why all , or maybe we do n't know , but most of the projects of the <unk> projects , we 've got to go back to hear .
This is my <unk> <unk> . It 's something very simple .
It 's a thing on it .
All of the morning I 'll come up .
And I know , I have a challenge as you can see .
I put the challenge to come to 95 percent .
But it 's so simple , that every time I 'm going to get it , he sends my information to Google Africa .
And my doctor 's doctor has access to him , so , he can see what it 's my problem of weight , not in the same moment in the same moment that they need , or some of that style , but I see it back .
But there 's another thing .
And as some of you know , I have more from four penguins in Twitter .
So every morning , I put me to my <unk> , and before you go back to my car , people begins to talk about : <unk> , today , I think you need to be a deep lunch .
That 's the best that you can go , because it 's pressure pressure pressure to help the patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also so that the patients go back .
On the other hand , you can be able to move to people from their chairs and together to develop some activity activity to have more control of their health .
Now , after the next week to be available .
This little <unk> <unk> to a iPhone or another device .
And people can be , from their homes , take their blood pressure , <unk> their doctor , and they share with others , for example , for 100 dollars .
This is the point where the patients take a position , you get to reclaim the control , and to be able to get their own boat , but we can also help care about health because of the challenges that we face , as the <unk> of the risk of the attention .
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to give the patients in the team .
And you can do it with techniques like these , but also by the opposite .
And one of the things we did like to deal with you .
We all have to affect them in the cars .
Maybe we have to have our cell in our cell .
We know where they are the <unk> force in <unk> .
We also also where they are all the <unk> .
And of course , we can find mental systems .
But where it 's the more close to help this patient ?
You know , but nobody knew .
No one knew where they get the <unk> <unk> , and the time .
What we did was going to do you .
We created a Web website , and we asked the audience that : If you see a <unk> , please <unk> , <unk> where , and when it 's open , because when it 's open , but when it 's open .
And more about 10 <unk> , they were born in the Netherlands .
The next step was looking at the application for that .
And we did a application for the iPad .
We created a application for <unk> , reality , to find these <unk> .
And every time you 're in the city of <unk> and someone could , you can use their iPhone , and the weeks to use their cell cell cell , which can find the more close , which can save lives .
And from today , I would like to introduce this , not only like <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
And we 're trying to get the world to the world .
We 're <unk> to all the colleagues in the world , in other universities , so we will help us find , work and act as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> in all the world .
Every time you 're from a square and somebody becomes , it can be a sound or somebody in you , you can find it .
I also like to go into companies in all the world that they could help help help us .
They could be services with a little services or <unk> people , for example , to see if the <unk> is still in their place .
Please , they go in this , and not just improve health , but we take the control of it .
Thank you very much .
I 'm here to share a photograph .
Or it 's <unk> .
Because , of course , are photographs that you ca n't take with their cameras .
My interest , by the photograph , I woke up with my first <unk> camera to the 15 years .
I started with my passion , but it was a little different because of the use the camera was in the entire process .
And when you take a photograph with a camera with a camera process when you lose it .
To me the photograph I had more than see with being in the right place , in the moment .
I seemed to do it .
And so I wanted to create something different , a process that I had to be able to be able to push the <unk> .
It 's like this : a building in a very <unk> road .
But it has a unexpected thing .
And even though it 's , it 's a <unk> level .
Or pictures like these ...
And when I say I 'm sorry to tell you .
Because , of course , it 's not something that I can <unk> , but I always want you to be able to be able to come from a way as a photograph .
So we 'll have to think a moment to discover the trick .
It 's going to see with a idea that I 've got to be able to be able to explore a idea .
But , what is the trick that makes real real ?
Are you the details or colors ?
<unk> the light ?
What is what happens ?
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective .
But at the end of it is about our way to make the world and how you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to perceive .
In fact , it 's not about if it 's not about if it 's not , but what we think it is .
So , I think the most simple are very simple .
I see it as a puzzle puzzle in which we take different pieces of reality , and we put them to create a human reality .
I 'll show you a simple example .
Here we have three objects , something that we can all do with the three-dimensional world .
But it 's a bit of a way you can create something that still seems three-dimensional ; as if they were .
But in the same time , we know that there 's not there .
So , it 's going to the brain because the brain does n't know the fact that that does n't have sense .
And I see the same process of photographs .
That 's actually in a different sense .
And the things that you do that a picture looks like , I think that they do n't think , the things that we do n't think , the things that we do in our everyday life .
But in a photographs of photographs , it 's very important to be able to be able to do , because of another way you do wrong .
So I would like to tell you that there 's three rules that they 're going to do to make them results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But you can create something like this .
So the first rule is that the combination of photographs has to have the same perspective .
Second , the pictures has to have the same kind of light .
And these two images , they were able to get up to the same car and with the same kind of light .
The third point is not impossible to teach the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect .
It has to be impossible to see where the image is going to see the image .
This is another example .
I could think that this is the image of a landscape , and the bottom 's part of a landscape .
But this image is completely a thousand of photographs of different places .
In the personal , I think it 's more easy to create a place that you find because you do n't need to put in that ideas that has in the head .
But it requires a lot of jobs .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew that I had a few months for <unk> , to find the different level for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish was going to put in a journey .
They are a different object .
And the part of the <unk> was sold in a <unk> .
And I know , even there 's the home house from the island of the island of the island .
So , to make a result , I think it 's completely planning .
It was always done with a motivation , a idea .
And then there are that these different photographs .
And here every piece is very well .
If you make a good job to the <unk> , the result can be very beautiful , and then it 's very <unk> .
All of the tools are there , and the only thing is our imagination .
Thank you .
I wanted to show you a slide on technology , very boring .
Please .
It 's a diagram that I took from a picture of me .
I 'm not interested interested in the details , but the general way .
It 's about a analysis that we were doing about the power of the <unk> and the power of the local networks .
The interesting thing about this is that this is that this , as many other that we try to see , it 's a kind of dark line in scale .
In other words , every step of here represents a order of magnitude in the scale scale .
Let 's talk about technology with <unk> curves .
Here 's something too .
And I 'm going to talk about .
Please , you get the lights .
<unk> <unk> because I write about paper .
Why do we make social curves in <unk> scales ?
The answer is that if you go in a normal curve in which , let 's say , these are the years , or some of time , and this would be any measure of the technology that I 'd like to deal with , the diagram would see something ridiculous .
It would be something like this .
It does n't say a lot .
But if you know , for example , some other technology , like the transport , in a <unk> curve would be very good , we see a dark line .
But if it happens something like this , you get a <unk> change .
If the technology 's technology , so fast as well , it was so fast as well , we could take a blind and be in Copenhagen in 30 seconds .
But you do n't go to that rate .
There 's no matter in the universal development of a <unk> growth that every few years of magnitude .
The question I want to explain it is -- looking at these <unk> curves , we see it not .
It 's not possible to make this change as fast .
<unk> one of two things .
Or you 're going to turn in a typical curve , I know how to make something completely different , or you may do something like this .
That 's everything that can happen .
I 'm sure , why I think you may happen something like this .
It 's going to be like , now we can be in the middle of a transition .
In this line is in a transition transition to be the world , a new way .
So what I 'm trying to ask , and ask me , it 's : What is that new way we put the world ?
Why again , what new state comes to the world ?
The transition seems very , very smart if we 're born in her .
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 , and the people used to talk about what in the year 2000 .
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is going to be the year 2000 .
That 's all what we see .
In other words , the future has hired , year after a year , over my life .
But I think it 's kind of that we feel that something is happening .
It 's a transformation . We can feel it .
And we know that it does n't have a lot of sense about 30 or 50 years , because it all will be so different than explain what we 're doing today does n't have any sense .
So I want to talk to talk about how to be , how could be that transition to be .
But to do that to do that to talk a little bit of things that do n't have a lot of things that do n't have to see with technology .
Because I think the only way to understand it is going to look and look at the other things .
The scale of time I 'd like to do it is the time of life in Earth .
I think this image has sense if we look at every billion years .
So , we go back about a half billion years when the Earth was a big rock rock with a lot of chemicals who would be able to get their around .
If you look at the way you 've got these chemicals , we give us a idea of how to put things .
And I think there 's theories to start to understand the origin of RNA , I 'm going to tell you a simple version of this , and it 's that , in that moment , there was floating from the oil , and it 's that , in that moment , there was floating from oil with all sorts of faith .
Some of those comes from a particular combination of chemicals that they were going to make the materials of the outside and so they were born it back back .
And they started it .
In a sense of sense , those were the more <unk> cell , those <unk> of oil .
But those were not living , in the current sense , because every one of them had a lot of chemicals .
And every time you 've got to have a <unk> distribution of the chemicals .
So each of it was a little different thing .
In fact , the <unk> that 's going to be able to be better to the hour of the local chemicals , they were more , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , more chemicals .
People lived over time , they were more like .
It was a way of life , life and chemistry , very simple , but the things are really interesting when you learned the trick of the road .
And in some way that we do n't understand very well , you 've learned to change information .
I 'll be able to get information , which was the recipe of the cell , in a special business called DNA .
In other words , <unk> in this disease without sense , a system of writing that they allowed to show you what they were to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
The amazing thing is that that 's a amazing system that we 've got a stable system since we 've built a half billion years .
Our matter , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same system system .
In fact , in fact , each of being living with exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
And one of the things I did only for fun -- now we can write things with this code .
So here I have 100 <unk> <unk> that I 'm trying to help people security people .
But it 's already -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we 're trying to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and the <unk> 10 to the eight times .
So if you want to 100 billion of my personal card , I have a lot for all the way -- in fact , for every person in the world and it 's here .
If it was a <unk> , you would have put it in a virus , and they would have to go up by the room .
What was the next step ?
Your DNA was a interesting step .
This made that these cells were happy for other billion years .
But then there 's another big step in the things that things are very different , and it was that these cells started to slow to respect and communicate information to be able to reach information communities .
I do n't know if you know , but bacteria can produce DNA .
So for example , for example , we 've built resistance to antibiotics .
Some of bacteria found the way to avoid cows and the <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria , and now there are a lot of carbon to cooperation because the bacteria they get to communicate .
This communication gave them place to get communities that , in the way , they were together together in that ; and they 'll get it together .
And so we take them together , or it 's that if a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community are going to go more and they were <unk> by evolution .
And the point of IDEO happened when these communities came out , in fact , they came up and decided to write all the day of the community that we were in a DNA of DNA .
The next point for life took other billion years ago .
And in that stage , we have communities communities , communities from many kinds of different cells working together as a only organism .
In fact , we are , we are a whole community .
We have a lot of cells that you do n't play .
The cell cell does n't matter without the heart , or the of the muscles , or the brain , and the brain .
So , these communities evolved and the most interesting levels that the cell , something we call a organism .
The next level happened inside these communities .
Those started <unk> information .
And to build structures structures that do n't do more than process information in community .
They are the <unk> structures .
People are the things that show the information that those communities built .
In fact , I started to participate inside the community to be the responsible structures for art , understanding and protect information .
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave us a bad advantage .
Because in that moment as individuals , which was learning to the part of a organism , and not the period of a real time .
So , a organism could , for example , I learned to not eat some of it , because I knew the last time they 've got .
And that could happen for life from a organism that I 've been built these structures structures structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who gave that .
So that 's why the fact that the nervous system built those structures structures structures .
Because evolution could now happen to a individual .
It could happen in the time to learn .
But then , of course , individuals found the trick of communication .
So for example , the most <unk> version we know is human language .
If we think , it 's a amazing invention .
I have a very complicated idea a idea , in the head .
I 'm here , I 'm going to put it out of <unk> , and I 'm lucky , building a idea that 's a similar idea , <unk> , in their head that 's a really analogy with mine .
But we take something very complicated to be a sound , in some sound of sound , and we make something very complicated in another brain .
That 's going to start to work as a organism .
In fact , as humanity , we 've started able to do it .
Now we 're going to try to try to try to make the organisms , we 'll be able to be able to get our methods of democracy , show it and sustainable information .
For example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
Life , the computer , the box , the <unk> tape , and so they are the mechanisms that we 're now built to explore that information .
And that tells us in something much more big , faster and able to create more than we did before .
Now evolution is going to happen .
You know , you saw the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in which made some evolution with the <unk> program , in our eyes .
And now we 've got to take the millions of time again .
The first stages of the story that I had taken a billion years ago each .
The next stages , the nervous system and the brain , took about hundreds of millions of years .
The next thing , the language , they got less than a million years .
And the next thing , as the computer , seems to take only a few decades .
And the process of the process , I guess it 's the right word to say something that it moves their own rate of change .
The more change , faster .
And I think that 's what we see in this explosion of the curve .
We can see that the process is .
But I 'm my life to build computers , and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> , not being possible without the recent context .
But now , now design objects of complexity that would be impossible for me to take me to me .
I do n't know that every single against that machine machine .
There 's thousands of millions .
In time , with the <unk> designers , we think a level of <unk> , we think about the machine , we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that I could n't have , it 's a much more far and faster than never before .
In fact , sometimes it has been able to be able to even understand well .
A kind of interesting method , I 've been using a thousand , is evolution .
We put it inside the machine , a evolutionary process that 's going on in the scale .
And for example , in the most late cases , we can create a program from a <unk> program of instructions .
We say , `` Please computer , you can run a hundred billion history of instructions ?
You could take these images of instructions , we 'll lose all of those programs , and take the most of those that we want to do ? ''
In other words , I read what I want .
Let 's say , I want to talk about numbers , to put a simple example .
So , we found the programs that we 're going to talk about numbers .
Of course , it 's a little likely to have a lot of instructions , <unk> numbers , so that none of them did .
But one , I could find two numbers in the right order .
And I said , `` computer , you could take 10 percent of those chemicals that will better made the task ?
<unk> those and <unk> the rest .
And now we 're going to be able to be able to get the numbers .
And let 's go back to <unk> , where a whole process of you get to sex . ''
Let 's take two programs , which <unk> children , which <unk> <unk> , and that children would have the properties of both programs .
So we got a new generation of a product of the product that they 've got a little bit of success .
And we say , `` Please . ''
It 's going to go back again .
You know some of them .
And to try again and <unk> with another generation .
Well , every generation is a few milliseconds .
So , I can do the equivalent to millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or , in cases , a few hours .
At the end of the end , we ended up with programs that they 're getting perfect numbers .
In fact , they are a lot more efficient , which I could have written to hand .
If I look at those programs I ca n't say how it works .
I 've been trying to see how it works .
They are a dark programs .
But it 's the test .
In fact , I know , I have the security of you to get the goal , because they come from a hundreds of thousands of thousands of programs that they did .
In fact , their lives are going to do .
One time I was in a attack with a <unk> , and he took a card and says , `` Look here .
He says , 15 plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that they work together to give you a quick eye . You do n't feel it hard ? ''
We know that the engineering of engineering do n't work very well when they get a little bit .
So we started to use the computers to make different design processes .
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the <unk> .
But yet , we do n't understand about all the choices that there are .
In that sense , it 's in front of us .
Now we use those programs to do computers , and so we can be able to get these different programs .
Or it 's , you know .
The thing is more fast , and so I think it seems as a surprise .
Because all of these technologies .
We 're seeing .
And we 're in a moment to the climate organisms when they got to come up .
We are the direction and we ca n't understand what we 're going to create .
We 're in the point of IDEO .
But I think something comes behind .
I think it would be very much of our part of our part thinking that we are the end of evolution .
And I think we are all part of the creation of what it 's going to go .
But now it comes to the lunch , and I think I 'll stop here before I 'm going on .
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change .
And I think this begins with a doctor , and that I am .
And I 've got a enough time to be able to give you part of my autonomous libraries in that .
I had trying to try the topic of my talk , let 's talk a little bit .
Why do n't ?
We 're about the end of the end of the end of the end .
We love the clothes , right ?
Life is full of amazing statistics .
There are hundreds of statistics .
It 's going to go out of the rules , '' talking about the statistics , and they use to form a big team team .
I 'm going to go in one of them , and I hope many of you .
It 's called average .
And we talk about 300 , from a <unk> that <unk> 300 .
That means that the <unk> is , three of 10 times .
And that means to take the ball from a game , and that anyone who does n't know the first base , they do n't come back to time , and the second end to be done .
three of 10 .
Do you know how to call a member of 300 in the course ?
Well , really good , maybe the team of the stars .
Do you know how to call a <unk> of 400 ?
On the way , that 's someone who 's about 10 , you 've got four .
<unk> -- as the youngest mine , the last player of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in a regular <unk> in a regular basis .
Now , I 'm looking at this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable , or maybe less , after what I tell you today .
Imagine that you 've got up and they 're forced to a surgeon that has also a art school company .
So it does n't work , right ?
Now imagine that they live in a place , and it will be going to have two wall , and his doctor 's medical doctor is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in <unk> .
But , you know something ?
She 's going to make this year .
They have been <unk> .
This is not working .
But I ask you .
What do you think you should be the average of a <unk> of a heart surgeon , or there 's a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> ?
One , very well .
And the truth of the issue is that no one of the issue of a good surgeon , from a doctor or <unk> .
What we do , yet , it 's going to the world , and I looked at the world , and I looked at the <unk> of being perfect .
You never , you know , I 'll be able to figure out a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it .
That was the message that <unk> when I was in five medicine .
I was a <unk> student .
One time , a day in high school said , I was taken back back to a <unk> .
Maybe .
<unk> in my little <unk> , in the <unk> of nurses from the University of Antarctica , not far from here .
And I learned about memory .
And in my class class , I 'll get the origin and work , the <unk> of each other , the <unk> of each other that comes out of the funeral , the key and the not .
And I even know the key thing about how we 've got the <unk> <unk> .
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge .
And I was very well ; I graduated with you .
And it 's <unk> school with the impression that if you get it all around , then we know everything , or the more possible , and so I 'm going to come from the mistakes .
And it worked for a time , until I met the lady .
And I was a letter in a student old here , in Cambridge when they brought the lady to the <unk> of the night where I worked .
And in the moment , I 'm going to go to the <unk> service .
And when the age of it would take me to be able to come to that patient to me .
And he said to the <unk> .
When I saw the lady , I was taught .
I heard a <unk> sound .
And when the <unk> , I 've heard a <unk> sound in both sides , what I 'm going to be a <unk> <unk> .
In these conditions , the heart is going to work and , in place , the blood , the blood goes to the lungs , the blood will get out of blood , and that 's why there 's difficulty .
And it was not hard to each other .
I did , and I had to work in the treatment that you could .
And I gave them , and they fight the pressure in their heart .
And I gave them <unk> , <unk> of water , so I could take a liquid .
And in a hour or two , she started to feel better .
And I felt very well .
And there was when I looked at the first mistake ; he sent her home .
In fact , they 've got two mistakes .
He sent her home without talk about the boss .
I do n't go on the phone , I do n't know what should have done , which was called my boss and <unk> with him for him .
And if my boss had seen , I would have been able to make information information .
Maybe I did for a good reason .
Maybe I did n't want to be a tone that <unk> attention .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take money , which could be able to give us from my patients without even to do n't tell my boss .
The second mistake that she was worse .
When you get her home , I do n't mention attention to a voice in my place who said , `` Wow , it 's not a good idea . No . ''
In fact , I was so painful that I asked to the house that I was waiting to the <unk> lady , `` You think it 's good if you go to her home ? ''
And I thought , and then he said with a lot of <unk> , `` Yes , I think I 'll be good . ''
I remember that as if it was yesterday .
So , it was that a high , and the ambulance back with the United States gave her home .
And I came to the hospital room .
The rest of that day , that afternoon , I had a bad place in the stomach .
But I started with my work .
At the end of the day , it 's going to leave the hospital , and I went back to the parking room where I was my car to go home .
He happened for the <unk> service .
And there 's another house , I do n't have the <unk> , I did n't know , but another .
There are all the <unk> , but there 's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see the patients .
The three words are : You know you ?
`` You know the patient who gave her home ? ''
I asked the other <unk> in a total <unk> .
`` Well she came up . ''
She was well .
But I looked at the edge of death .
At a time of a hour of having come to her home , after I gave me the high , there 's a dance and his family called the self-esteem , the United States called the <unk> , the United States gave the war with a blood system of <unk> .
I 'm going up and was blue .
The personal child 's personal .
They gave them to get the blood pressure .
And they had a artificial .
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal .
I had a kind of feelings because after the <unk> was in local and waiting against all hope that we get .
And in the two or three days , I would never get it .
I had a brain model .
The family did .
And in eight or nine days , you 'll get it back to what was happening .
And at the top day , I 'll go up . The lady <unk> , wife , mother and grandmother .
They tell you that never forget the names of the ones they die .
That was my first experience .
Now , the weeks ago , I 'm going to go up for it , and I found by the first time you would feel that there is in our medical culture , and I felt only , <unk> , but they ca n't feel that shame .
You make the peace and never do that mistake .
It 's that shame that 's going to be .
And the shame I 'm talking about is what makes us feel very wrong by inside .
It 's what tells us not that that we did was wrong , but we are bad .
And that felt .
And it was not for my boss ; he was a magic .
I talked about the family , and I 'm sure that <unk> the things , and you know that I do n't know .
And I got these questions .
Why do n't give me to my boss ? Why gave her home ?
And in my worst moments , why do you get a mistake as well ?
Why did medicine do medicine ?
I 'll try to just that feeling was <unk> .
And I started happy .
And in a day , he turned up the sky and finally came up the sun , and I asked me if I 'm going to tell me better again .
And I did a deal with me in which if you get the efforts to be perfect to be perfect , would not make those voices .
And so it was .
I went to work .
But he turned to happen .
Two years later , it was like in the emergency department in a community in the South South , and then I got a man of 25 years with a pain in the <unk> .
I was very familiar .
And he watched here .
I looked at her <unk> , I was a little <unk> .
I 'm going to come up and he sent her home .
But while he came up to the door , I was going to go up to the door .
Two days later , when I 'm going to do my change change , my grandmother asked me to talk about me in their office .
And I gave the three words : You know you ?
You know the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk> ?
Well , he ended up and did n't have a <unk> <unk> .
I had a <unk> <unk> called <unk> .
You can look at Google . It 's a infection , not the <unk> , but it 's from the top , and that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
He 's , fortunately , no .
They were born it 's going to be <unk> , and they got a few days .
And then the same period of shame and <unk> , then I got to work and came to work , until it happened to work , until it happened and again .
Two times in the same end of sea , not <unk> .
And it 's a great effort , especially to work in a hospital , you know , <unk> to 14 patients at the same time .
But in both cases , I did n't come back to home , and I do n't think there 's a thing .
One of them thought , I thought I had a <unk> calculation .
I 'll get a <unk> , but it turned a little bit . A colleague that I was called the patient would have a sort of sensitivity in the top right and called the surgeon .
The other patient was a lot of entertainment .
I get a <unk> to <unk> , and I asked my colleague that you get it .
I looked at , and as you know some of a sensitivity in the right end , called the surgeon .
They were trained , and it 's a good day .
But every case I was <unk> , I was born .
But I 'd like to tell you to tell you that the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it 's a guy .
They have been over the past five years .
Just , they 're interested and without support .
And here 's the problem : if I ca n't go back and talk about my mistakes , if I ca n't find the <unk> that I tell me what happens , how do you share this with my colleagues ?
How do I teach you this for you to do this for you .
If I go to a place like this , you do n't have idea about what you think about me .
When it was the last time you heard about a failure of failure , after failure .
Of course , in one party , you 'll talk about the mistakes of other doctors , but you do n't hear someone talking about their own mistakes .
And if I know , and my colleagues also , that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg , I believe that they would have to be around the eyes .
This is the system we have .
The total of the mistakes .
It 's the system in which there 's two , which are two groups , which they do n't know , which you can not sleep and the ones that you ca n't sleep and the ones who have a lot of results .
And it 's almost like a whole reaction , as we start to play that person .
We have the idea that if I came from medicine to the people who make mistakes , we 're going to be sure .
But that helps two problems .
In 20 years about power , and journalism , I 've done a personal study of bad , the medical study to learn as possible , from the first article that I wrote for the uncle , because of the first article that I wrote for the editor to my program , `` Grand <unk> . ''
And what I learned is that the mistakes are not .
We worked in a system in which they 're going on every day , in which one of each day , in which one of each day , in which one of every 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong , or the governments is not right .
In this country , they come up 24 , they go up from <unk> doctors .
The World Institute of the United States took 100 .
In both cases , it 's about <unk> <unk> , because we do n't know the problem as we should .
And so they are things .
It 's a <unk> system where the knowledge has taken every two or three years ago , and we do n't get it .
The story of the dream .
And we ca n't go back to her .
We have the cognitive creativity that allow us to do a perfect story of a patient with pain .
Now , let 's take to the same patient with a pain in the chest , it comes up with the eyes , and it comes up with <unk> , and it 's going to go back to alcohol , and suddenly , my story 's <unk> .
It 's not the same story .
I 'm not a robot ; I do n't do things always like .
And my patients are not cars . They do n't know their symptoms always .
So this is all of this , the mistakes are absurd .
So , if we take the system as it taught us , and we took all the <unk> , good , not no one .
And with it , that people do n't want to talk about their biggest cases ?
In my program , `` <unk> <unk> , five '' '' -- it 's basically a example , say , `` This is my worst mistake . ''
And his students are <unk> , <unk> the head and <unk> them , and I 'll get to tell their stories .
They want to tell their stories , want to share them .
They can be able to say , `` Look , not the same mistake . ''
They need a context where we can be doing it .
They need a medical culture .
And it begins with a doctor every time .
The medical doctor is human , you know human , you know human , and they do n't get out of their mistakes , but it 's supposed to learn about what happened to teach others .
They lose their experiences with them .
It 's support for those who talk about their mistakes .
<unk> the mistakes of other people do n't know , but it 's a <unk> way and support to support them .
And it works in a medical culture that recognize that human beings do with the system , and when this happens , they 're going to get high mistakes in when .
My name is Brian .
I 'm a magic doctor .
I 'm human .
And I feel a lot , but I feel , but I want to learn about something that can be able to learn .
I do n't know what about me , but I can live with that .
And let me conclude with three words : I remember it .
Do you know how many decisions take a day ?
Do you know how much , in a week ?
I just made a survey to more than 500 people , and the average number of choice who says to take a American American , they are a half in the day .
Not a lot of a research , in a research research for a week to a group of companies .
The researchers , the different tasks of the <unk> , and the time that we 're going to be able to make decisions with those tasks .
They found that , in average , <unk> <unk> jobs per week .
You know , every job has lots of <unk> .
The half of those decisions gave nine minutes or less .
Just a 12 percent a hour or more than their time .
Now think about their elections .
Do you know how many of the <unk> of nine minutes , and how many of a hour ?
How does the way that the decisions ?
Now , I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of what you 're now : choose to the <unk> .
I want to talk about the problem and about a different solutions .
As I talk about this I 'm going to ask a few questions and I need to know their answers .
When you do a question , as I 'm sure , you get the hand just if you want to bring to these calories .
In another way , when you do a question , if you do a question , if your answer is positive please .
And now my first question of the day : You 're ready to hear about the problem of the choices of choices ?
Thank you .
Now , there 's a student student student , <unk> the supermarket in very , very high , at least in that time was very sophisticated .
It 's called <unk> .
It was almost like to go to a park .
There were like 250 and some different different different , more than a lot of a different different different different different different different different different different different different types . And this was when you look at water water .
I loved to go to that store , but in one time I asked me , why do n't read anything ?
This is the <unk> .
They were more than a different different different different different , including the ones who were in a <unk> box .
I once I decided to come on , and he said , `` It 's good this strategy to do all these choices ? ''
He gave me the <unk> <unk> , they were usually with their cameras .
And we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> .
Man .
They had different different .
<unk> one of <unk> , right to the <unk> .
We put there from six kilos , or you can see two , and we look at two things : First , where people was trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Most people would go up when there was 24 , 60 percent , which when there was just six , 40 percent .
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> .
Here we find the opposite effect .
And so he turned up when there was 24 , just three percent , just three percent came to buy .
And so he turned up when there were six , we saw that 30 percent later .
If we do these calculations , people had six times more than a few times more likely to buy , if they were five .
Well , let n't take you to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it , <unk> less , it 's a good thing to explain the <unk> , but it turns out that the problem of the rules of choices , makes us good decisions .
We decided to decide , even when this does n't help us .
Now , the topic of the day : the financial income .
I 'm going to give you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , in which we look at the decisions about risk for a million Americans , from about a million than a half of the country .
We 've been able to see if the number of <unk> in public molecules , the program program , the <unk> program , <unk> people to save the future .
And we found that I 'm true .
We had to be able to be able to make them from two , until it 's a different choices .
We found that the biggest was the number of funding , there were less participation .
So if we look at the end , we see that in the communities that they have two to , the rate of violence was 50 percent or more , not as high as I would like .
And in the way that you get about about 60 to , the rate of it turned to the 60 .
It turns out that even if you try to participate , when there 's more choices , even in that case , there 's the negative consequences .
So , for people who decided to participate , the most of us , the most people are the number of choices , more people are able to avoid the actions or the business .
In the way there were more choices , they were more willing to invest in the market .
But none of these decisions are the ones that we 're going to be able to take the well-being of the future of future .
In the 1970s , we 've seen three consequences of the main consequences of you can take more and more possibilities .
The most likely is that <unk> the decision , that the <unk> even when this went on in the interest .
It 's more likely to take the good decisions ; in the health and health .
They 're more likely to choose things less , even though they 're going to go better .
The main reason is that <unk> with looking at that particular variety of <unk> , humor , but they 're not able to make the patterns to be able to be able to figure , and choose from that amazing exhibition .
Today , I want you to give you four different techniques that we 've got , from a way or another , in different research , so you can try to participate in their business .
The first is , <unk> .
You 've heard before , but there 's never been more than today , which is less .
People always know when I say , `` <unk> . ''
They care about lose space in the <unk> .
But in fact , what we 're seeing in every time , you 're looking at it , you get to cut up , you get from choices , they 'll be a increase in the business , <unk> the costs , there 's a better experience in choice .
When I 'm going to <unk> it out of a thousand different types of <unk> , <unk> , you saw a cost of 10 percent in zero .
When you put it up , I 'll put the products for the <unk> of farmers who are less , you can be able to be able to be able to get it up in 10 percent , by two of us : biggest costs .
You know that the <unk> of today , in average , these are 45 of products .
In a shop , you 've got about 100 products .
But the biggest store , the biggest store in the world is <unk> , and it does n't be a kind of products -- a guy 's kind of competition .
In the world 's world , I think that one of the best examples that have come on what the best examples you 've got about how much better people is the <unk> of David <unk> .
Everybody from Harvard , they 're going to come up to a <unk> of life .
People who really want to choose , you have to give you 20 dollars , not 300 or more .
You know that often people say , `` I do n't know like it .
They are all important choices . ''
The first thing I do is to ask the employees , `` You do the differences that are between those choices .
And if you do n't tell you , you do n't do their customers . ''
This afternoon , before I start this session , I was able to start with Brazil .
He said that I would be willing to give you to the people of this audience , and it 's about the people of this audience , with everything to the most more the world .
Here , a description .
I want you to read .
I 'm going to leave you a few seconds to read and then I want you to give you a wish if you 're ready to take the <unk> of compassion .
( Wow . You know , you know , you know , you 're going to accept the risks .
Is n't more ?
Well , I 'm going to show you something more .
You know that there was a trick .
Who is ready for that journey ?
I think I 'm going to hear more hands .
All right .
In fact , you have more information in the first day , which in the second , but I can <unk> and say that the second time was more real .
Because the images were going to see more real .
This is allowed to the second technique to explore the problem of choices .
Now , for people to understand the differences between choices , they have to understand the consequences of every option , and that the consequences they have to be able to feel very , very much .
Why is why people spend 15 percent of 30 percent more in average when it uses a half of <unk> or credit , which when it uses new ?
Because it does n't mean money .
It turns out that to do more real , it can be a very positive tool for people else .
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , about <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> , these people were in a meeting in which they were <unk> to a plan .
Now , that meeting , which was exactly like it , we did a little bit .
The thing that we put it to the personal things that you think about the positive things that would be able to be in their lives if they get more money .
With this <unk> , there was a increase in 20 percent , and a increase in the amount of people who were interested in save or in what they wanted to put back in their lifestyle .
The third technique is <unk> .
We can make more categories of choices .
For example , this is a study that we did in a single study .
And we saw that in the <unk> <unk> is going to the top of the <unk> <unk> , the exhibition of leaders may have been known from a different different different types .
But , you know ?
Because I wanted to ask me how it would be .
These are two <unk> .
One is called `` <unk> '' and the other , `` <unk> . ''
If you think of the left is <unk> , and the right of the right is <unk> , give you a job .
( Wow .
If you think of the left is <unk> , and the right of the right is <unk> , give you a job .
Well , something else .
It turns out it 's right .
The left is <unk> and the right of the right is <unk> , but you know something ?
Now , here 's a bit very <unk> .
People have to tell you something that you get , not to the way we 're going to happen .
You often see this problem with a huge cure with a huge cure .
Do you know who they are ?
My fourth category : <unk> complexity .
It turns out that we can make a lot more information that we think , if only the <unk> .
We have to increase the complexity complexity .
I 'm going to show you a example of what I mean .
Let 's look at a complicated decision ; the <unk> of a car .
This is a <unk> <unk> of cars that allows it up .
You have to take 60 decisions , to put the car .
And these decisions are moving in the number of choices that takes each other .
It 's a <unk> , color color of the car . I 've got a lot of possibilities .
BL , communication box , four choices .
What I 'm going to do is to measure the order of the decisions .
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choices , sex colors , to a few .
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices , four boxes , to sex colors .
And what I 'm going to look at ?
What are involved .
If you get it out the <unk> <unk> in every decision , this says that they 're like , or it 's : we 're losing .
We found that what you 're going to have a few people to a few people , put the button by a <unk> and again , and another more .
They lose them .
If you go from a few choices to a lot , they 're going on .
The same information , the same number of choices .
The only thing I did was protecting the order of information .
If we started a easy , you learn to choose .
Although the <unk> box do n't tell you about the <unk> of the <unk> , of all ways we 'll go to choose .
We talked about a product that we 're building , we 're going to take us to do it with the process .
To show it .
I 've been talking about four techniques to explore the problem of choices : <unk> , we 'll be able to make a little bit , <unk> , we can do more categories with less choices ; the complexity of complexity .
All of these techniques that I 've got to help care of the people , or better , for you , to use it in their issues , or for people who they get them .
It 's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being able to try to choose .
And the more likely to be in our best choices , we can be able to create a art art .
Thank you very much .
In the late years , in the European Germany , if you had a computer machine , if you had a writing machine to be <unk> with the government .
I had to show a piece of a text of example , with the machine .
And this for the government could reduce the origin of the spirit .
If you had a written with the wrong message , you could be able to be able to be able to the origin of the idea .
In the West , we do n't imagine that somebody could do this , what you could do this , it 's a lot of this <unk> freedom .
We never do that in our countries .
But today , in 2011 , if you give you a huge printer of any big computer , and they used a page , that page , that page I 'll end up with a pattern of one of one of one of one of one of one of one .
That 's happening today .
And nobody seems a lot for this .
This is a example of the ways that our governments use technology in us , the citizens .
And it 's one of the three causes of problems in the network .
If you see what happens in the world in line , we can put them from the deaths in their appearance .
There 's three groups .
They 're the <unk> .
It 's like Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of magnitude .
The cell cell is very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use them to make a lot of money , a huge amounts .
Now , there 's really many cases that 's going on the line , especially , which <unk> money with their attacks .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
So this is a <unk> .
This is amazing .
This is <unk> <unk> .
These are Doug Anderson , <unk> <unk> , etc. , etc .
These guys do their own cold , but they do it for media media by <unk> , to make money from our sun when we live in line ; or we 're able to get the key to get information from our hands when we live in a computer computer .
The secret service of the U.S. , two few months ago , I think about the end of this gentleman , we know , and this is , and this realized I had a billion dollars when it was building .
`` The <unk> Stewart goes up ; they know their own .
And I tell you that today is more likely than any of us , it 's a victim of a surgeon that 's a <unk> .
And it 's very obvious that this is wrong in worse .
In the future , most of the <unk> crimes .
Now , the second group of glad in importance that we see today today is not made by money .
There 's another thing that moves , you know , you know , the course , you know the opinions , you know the opinions , you know the laughter .
<unk> as you 've got up in the last 12 months ago , a <unk> paper in the line .
Those are the three facts , which they do it for money , the <unk> that they do for us to see it , and the last group are the governments who create .
And then we see cases like <unk> .
That 's a good example of <unk> attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a authority of <unk> of the Netherlands or , actually , it was .
<unk> the end of the past because of a <unk> .
<unk> the security of the website , and it 's a <unk> .
The week last week I looked at , in a meeting with the <unk> government , I asked one of the leaders if you could have the death of the people if you have the death of people to cause the attack of the attack .
And the answer of him was yes .
So , how about people to cause a attack of these ?
<unk> is a <unk> authority .
<unk> .
Why do you get the beauty ?
Well , you need if you have a website with <unk> , services <unk> <unk> , services <unk> .
Except that <unk> a nuclear authority .
And that 's going to minimize it out of <unk> .
And in the case of the case of <unk> happened exactly that .
And what happened in the moon and those things that have happened , for example , in Egypt ?
Well , in Egypt , in Egypt , the <unk> of the secret secret of 2011 in 2011 , and during the <unk> of the building , we found a lot of messages .
Now , those messages was here called `` <unk> . ''
And inside that sitting there were notes from a company with company in Germany , which was taken the <unk> government to create a large scale of the citizens of the country .
They had to get this tool by Venezuela to the individual government .
The company company is just here .
Or it 's , the civil governments gave us tools to the governments , so we do this to do this to their citizens .
But the Western governments also do this .
For example , in Germany , it 's just a couple of weeks ago , I was just a couple of weeks I found the <unk> <unk> ; a <unk> used for the <unk> government to address their own citizens .
If you do it , in a bad case , it 's pretty obvious than your phone is <unk> .
But today , it 's more there .
It 's the connection to the Internet .
<unk> , even tools as the <unk> <unk> to protect our computer , with a <unk> , to give you to see all the communication , and listen to the individual , to get our data .
When we think , in things like these obvious answer should be , `` Well , it seems to be `` Well , it seems a bad thing , but actually , I do n't teach me because I 'm a honest artist .
Why do you try ?
I do n't have anything . ''
And that argument does n't have sense .
It 's in play .
Technology does n't know .
It 's not a question of privacy .
It 's about freedom against control .
If you could trust our governments today in 2011 , any right than <unk> today , it will be forever .
<unk> <unk> in any future , in a administration that we could have in 50 years ?
These are the questions that we have to do in the next 50 years .
Here 's where live .
These are the cows of my dad , at the bottom , and behind the cows , the National <unk> <unk> .
The National National Park is not based in the highest part of the South , what means that animals are that animals as we 're able to perceive it out of the park .
And it , as the <unk> , they go , and this is what they do .
<unk> our livestock .
This is one of the <unk> , and so soon we took it in the morning , and we found it up in the morning , and we found it dead , I felt very bad because it was the only thing we had .
My community , the <unk> , we think that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> , and so that 's why we value .
So I grew up a lot of them .
They were going to protect our community , and they also get it out with the problem .
So they were dead .
This is one of the six messages who killed in Nairobi .
I think about this is so a few in the National National <unk> .
A child in my community , of the six to the six years , it 's responsible to give them from his father and this was the same thing I 'm going to me .
So I had to find a way to solve this problem .
My first idea was to use fire , because I thought that they were afraid .
But I realized that in fact , that did n't have it , because they even try to see the <unk> to see the <unk> .
I do n't take me .
A second idea was using a <unk> .
I was going to be able to describe the messages to be close to me .
But they are very smart . They had the first day and you saw the <unk> , and they were , but the second day , they got and said , but the second day , they were always , is always here . And so I came and sell animals .
So one night I was walking around in the front of the writing with a hip and that day they did n't come .
I found that they have afraid you have fear .
So I had a idea .
And I got a switch with the <unk> , and put the lights .
And this is a little rate of a <unk> .
<unk> everything .
As you can see , the solar cell had lost the battery and the battery <unk> to the little box , and I call it a system .
And the box 's <unk> ?
As you can see , the <unk> will go down , because of there is where they come up .
And so it 's like you see it when you see it when they come from night .
The <unk> lights , and I 'll try to the <unk> , so I think I 'm walking by the <unk> , but I 'm looking at my bed .
Thank you .
So I put in my house two years ago , and since then , we 've never got to have problems with the eggs .
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea .
One of them is from this grandmother .
He had got a lot of animals and asked if I could put the lights .
I said it .
You can see it . You can see the bottom , these are the lights for sharks .
From then , I 've got in seven houses in my community , and they 're wearing a lot .
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya , to make other relativity like the funeral , Sarah , and also it 's going to make it to make their elephants elephants .
Thank you to this invention , I had the way to get a fight in one of the best schools of Kenya , we 've been able to be 16 , and I 'm very excited .
My new school now is going to bring them and <unk> .
And even led to my friends to my community and we built lights in the homes who do n't have , and I teach you how you do .
So , a year ago , it was just a child in the front of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father , and they used to see a fly to fly , and he said that I would be inside you .
And today here I 'm .
I had a chance to come in a plane for the first time to TED .
My great dream is to be to be a engineer of furniture , and it when they go .
I used to talk to the sharks , but now as my invention is allowed to the cows of my dad , and the leaders , we can be with the violence without no conflict .
<unk> <unk> . What in my language means , so much .
Chris Anderson : I do n't think the exciting thing that 's listening to a story as you .
So , you 've got a fight . Richard <unk> : Yes .
CA : You 're working in other different inventions .
What is the next in your list ?
<unk> : My next invention is -- I want to do a electric , a lot of electric ?
<unk> : Yes , you know , it was invented the electric , but I want to do the mine .
CA : Now , I 'm going to take it a time , right ? You know , I 'm going to <unk> : I 've made before , but I 've been trying to have a <unk> , but I 've got a <unk> , but I got a <unk> , you 're a big .
We go to <unk> in every step of me , friend me .
Thank you very much .
When I was a little , I thought my country was the best of the planet .
And I grew up and I grew up a song called `` No <unk> . ''
And I felt very proud .
In school , we 'll get all the time in the story of <unk> <unk> , but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the doctors .
When I 'm going to ask me about the rest of the world , I thought , I thought about my life in North Korea , until it all changed a sudden .
When I was seven years ago , I saw my first <unk> .
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and I would have never read it .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom gave home a letter of the colleague of my sister .
He said , `` When you do this , the five members of the family , you 'll be able to be able to be in this world , because we do n't go back in the two weeks .
We 're <unk> together in the floor , and our bodies are so severe , we 're going to go to die . ''
I was very <unk> .
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country .
As a little time , when I was born in front of the train station , I saw a terrible thing I ca n't stop my memory .
One woman without a dead woman in the street , I put a <unk> child in their arms watching the face of his mother without being able to do anything .
No one of them , because they were very worried about them and their families .
A huge version of the North Korea in the north of the time .
At the end , more than a million State died during the flower and just a few <unk> , insects and cortex of tree .
They also made more and more than the <unk> of energy , all my place was completely in the night in the night except by the lights of the sea in China , just across the river from my house .
I always asked why they had light and we do n't .
This is a picture of North North Korea in the night in the night with the neighbors .
This is the <unk> <unk> , which comes out of ice between Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be a very <unk> in certain points , we 'll try to go back to <unk> .
But many die .
Sometimes , I look at bodies in the river .
I ca n't tell you the details of how the North Korea , but I can only say that during the years of the 1970s , I can only say that for the years of the afternoon I was taken to live with they share .
But I just thought I would be sure about my family for short time .
I would never have been able to get 14 years back to live together .
In China , it was hard to live as a young woman without my family .
I did n't have a idea of how it would be life as <unk> .
But so soon I learned that it 's not just hard , but also dangerous , because the <unk> oil in China were using illegal immigrants .
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity , and it would be <unk> to a <unk> fate of back in North Korea .
One day , my worst research was actually , when I went up by the Chinese police , and I 'll get it in the police station .
Somebody had led me to be <unk> , then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and I made a lot of questions .
I was <unk> .
I thought my heart was going to go back .
If it 's not a natural , it could be <unk> and <unk> .
I thought my life was going to end .
But I had to control my emotions and the questions .
At the end of the MIT , a teacher said to another , `` This was a bad report . '' She 's not <unk> . ''
And I 'll go . It was a ceiling .
Some of China in China are going to go back in the Arab country .
But many of you can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> .
These women were very lucky .
And if the Taliban came up , they were taken up after a international system .
These were not very lucky .
Every year , it 's going to go back in China and <unk> in North Korea , where they 're overweight , and they are in public .
Although I went back on , a lot of others have n't have a lot .
It 's tragic that the Taliban have to teach their entrepreneurs and fight so hard to survive .
Even after learning a new language , and I find work , all their world can <unk> in a moment .
It 's why , after 10 years of writing my identity , I 've decided to go back to South Korea .
And I started a new life again .
<unk> in South Korea was a lot of more than what I needed .
The English was very important in Korea , I had to begin to learn my third language .
And also , I understood that there was a great gap between South South and South .
We are all over , but in inside , we 've got to be very different because of a high years , because of it .
They even just put a crisis crisis .
I 'm <unk> or <unk> ?
Where is I ?
Suddenly , there was no country that I could call with me with me .
If you go to life in Korea , it was not easy , I did a plan , I started to study for a plan . I started to study for the University .
Now , when I went to <unk> my new life , I got a call .
The North North Korea <unk> something of money who came back to my family , and , as punishment , my family was going to be the force to the force to a place .
They had to come out of the end of you .
And so I started able to plan how to help you .
They have to travel long to the road to freedom .
It 's almost impossible to protect the border between North Korea and South Korea .
So , you know , I took a flight in China , and I brought up to the border with North Korea .
And so my family could n't talk the Chinese , I had to teach them , in some way , for more about three miles through China , and then through the South Asia .
The journey in <unk> , I took a week , and almost we had a few times .
One time , our bus was taken up , and that by a president of the Chinese police .
He came out of all .
As my family could n't understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be born .
When the Chinese president came up to my family , I 've been able to go back and I said that they were people <unk> .
I looked at <unk> , but fortunately me .
We did all the road to the border border .
But I had to spend almost all my money to move to the <unk> signal in front .
But even after we go to the border , my family was born , and they come up to get the border of <unk> .
And then , after the pay , and he turned up , my family was born in a month .
But at the time , my family was born , and then in the time in the <unk> capital .
This was one of the more low dots in my life .
I did everything to take my family , and we were so close , but my family was <unk> in prison to a short distance from the South Korea .
I was , and he was born between the office in the office and the police station , so trying to take my family .
But I did n't have enough money to pay more to pay more cows .
I met the hope .
In that moment , or the voice of a man , `` What is the problem ? ''
I was so surprised that a <unk> tells me .
With my heart English , and with a dictionary , I took the situation , and without example , the man was the <unk> , and I gave me the rest of the money for my family and for each other , and they 'll go to prison .
I 've got it with all my heart , and I asked , `` Why do n't help me ? ''
`` Do n't tell you . ''
`` I 'm helping the <unk> people . ''
I realized that that was a pencil in my life .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> a new hope to me and for the <unk> people when we needed it .
And I showed me that the kindness of the advice and the support of the international community are really the hope that the <unk> people needs .
With the time , after our long journey , my family and I came back in South Korea .
But they get their freedom is only half of the battle .
Many of their families are aware of their families , and when you get a new country , they start with a little or nothing of money .
So , we can measure of the international community with education , language of the English language , of work , and more .
We can also act as bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world .
Because a lot of us , because many of us do still in contact with family , and we 'll get information and money , and money that 's helping to change North Korea since .
I 've been very lucky , I 've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help you to give them to give you to a chance to be used to support robots .
I 'm sure you 're going to see more and more <unk> <unk> in all the world , including in the TED stage .
Thank you .
I live in Cambridge Center .
This is Cambridge Center : shops of <unk> , food , <unk> <unk> .
And then the <unk> of the city came up and thought , we 're going to change the name of Cambridge Center , so that 's something more , so that 's going to go to the South , so if this <unk> what 's actually wrong in the city .
This is the South , <unk> , food , food , <unk> <unk> .
At the same thing that we 've spent millions of other Americans , live in a desert desert , the United States Center , home from the food places to take and eat in the car .
The funny thing is that the way of food , to give you more people than food in the car .
People are dying from infectious diseases in Cambridge Center .
For example , the art rate in my neighborhood , is five times more than , say , it 's going to say , it 's like 15 miles .
I 'll be able to see that this happen .
And I ask me , how do n't have access to food food , and if every time you get back to home you see the effects of the current system that is in their neighborhood ?
So I see chairs , and they get as cars used .
I look at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And I think this is to stop .
I think the problem is the solution .
The food is the problem and it 's the solution .
And so I 've got to draw 45 minutes old minutes , and back to buy a apple who does n't have white .
What I did , it was used a forest forest in front of my house .
In a center of land that we call a <unk> .
It 's about 45 me three me .
The point is , which is going to the city .
But you have to get it .
I said , `` Well , I can do what you go on , because it 's my responsibility and I have to get it . ''
So it was like I decided to do .
So my group and I was a <unk> <unk> , we put it , and we started to use our forest forest , trees <unk> , you know , nine and nine , the nine or the nine .
What we do , we are a sort of <unk> , we are a kind of <unk> , by fact , from all of the entire city , from all the city , and we also know what we do is free .
And the garden , I was beautiful .
And then someone would happen .
The city came back to me , and I gave me a <unk> saying I had to put my garden , the <unk> has been able to protect me .
And I said , `` Let 's actually ?
A order to be able to use food in a piece of land in a piece of land that nobody does ? '' And then it was like , `` Well , <unk> . ''
Because this was not going to go .
KS Times had the story written by Steve <unk> , and I talked about the <unk> and one of the <unk> members , they put a sign in <unk> , with a <unk> , with a success .
We had the door in our hands .
My <unk> , even I called to say , and they get what we were doing .
I mean , we go , why do n't ?
Life is the city in the U.S. with more <unk> <unk> .
It 's about 10,000 miles from <unk> <unk> .
That 's going to 20 Central 20 .
That 's a enough way to use <unk> billion plants .
Why do n't you do you do this ?
<unk> a plant to give a billion , 10 thousand seeds .
When a dollar , I 'll give you 75 dollars a result .
It 's my uncle , when I tell people , they lose your own food .
<unk> your own food is like print your own money .
You see , I have a legacy for Cambridge Center .
I grew up there . You know my children there .
I 'm going to be a part of this reality , which was <unk> for me for other , and I 'm going to be able to get my own reality .
You see , I 'm a artist .
<unk> is my <unk> , I take a art .
Now , as a artist 's artist , which <unk> walls , I 'll be able to go back and <unk> .
I use the garden , the land , like a piece of building , and plants and the trees and the trees , are my <unk> .
It 's starting to see what the land can do . If you say that it 's your teeth .
You ca n't imagine the amazing thing that is , and how to change people .
What happened ?
I 'm what my garden became a tool tool , in transformation of my neighborhood .
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the land .
We are the land .
It 's going to see how to see the boys .
The thing is the more <unk> act of <unk> , which you can do , especially in a <unk> .
You know , you get it .
I remember a day , who came a mother and his daughter , they were like the <unk> of night and they were in my garden , and then you see very <unk> .
I know , good , man , I was sitting there , and I said , you know , you do n't have to do this .
This is in the street for a reason .
I was surprised to look at you to see people who was so close to me , and this was just understood why I do this , people would tell me that people go to say , `` Wow , do n't tell you that people are going to ask your food ? ''
I 'm going to say , `` Please do n't have afraid that you go to stop . ''
That 's in the street .
That 's about it .
I want you to take you , but I want you to make your health . ''
There was another time in which I put a garden in a shelter to be in the center of Los Angeles .
They were these guys , I 'll try to download the truck .
It was fun , I brought their stories about how this had taught , and how to use company with his mom and his grandmother , and it was fun to see how this changed changed , so it 's just for a moment .
So , <unk> , you 've got a company , maybe 20 .
We 've got , as about 50 people who come up , they work and participate , all in a plan .
If the young boys , the boys <unk> .
If they were paralyzed , there were rational , but if nothing of this is actually taught , if you do n't explain how the food stress and the body , they eat the way they put it in front .
I see young people who want to work , but you have this thing in which they 're done , I see the color of color who are in this road designed for them , which is not going to do any side .
With the <unk> , I see a chance in which we can train these kids who were able to train these children to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who knows ?
Maybe it 's the next George George Washington <unk> .
But if we do n't change the composition of the land , we never do it .
Now this is one of my imagination , this is something I want to do .
I want to use it all of a <unk> , where people can share food in the same room .
I want to take you to you , and you can give you a healthy perception .
They do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about things for free , because it 's not sustainable .
It 's a little bit of sustainability , it 's you have to be <unk> .
So I 'm talking about it is to come to work to the people , they get the boys of the street , which you know the joy , the pride and the honor of income their own food , the European markets .
What I want to do here , we have to do it happy .
I want you to go in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We have to change the message of what it 's a <unk> .
If you 're not a coin , you 're not a <unk> .
You know , the <unk> will take her ?
That 's their weapon of choice .
In addition , if you want to come up with me , well , if you want to see me , I do n't look at me if you want to say , I 'm not able to tell you , you want to go back to talk to do some guy -- to talk about to talk about to talk to do some guy .
If you want to see you , they come back to the garden with their ears so that we could use something .
Excellent . Thank you .
Thank you .
( <unk> of <unk> . ( <unk> <unk> ) You know , it 's a very beautiful road .
It 's made out of Calcutta , and it 's a good material to drive , but it 's not always , especially in days as today , in which it was a lot .
You can have a great amount of water in the advent of it .
And especially if you go into their dreams and these cars go , that 's not very cool .
And then , you can do a lot of noise .
It 's a <unk> material , and if we built them , as in the Netherlands , very close to cities , would be able to make a <unk> road .
The solution for that is going to be able to go out of it .
It 's eliminated , a material that we use now in most of the <unk> of the Netherlands , it 's got to explain and the water can go through him , why all the water can go through it , and they 'll have a road why it 's easy to drive , and they do n't get water .
The noise also made in these <unk> .
Because it 's very a view , all of the noise , that 's a very <unk> road .
They also have a bit , of course , and the course of this road is that you can see .
What is you going to get ? You see that in this road , the <unk> of the surface they go .
First of a stone , then many more and more and more and more and more and more , and then -- well , you do n't do that .
And then , we can also take more and more damage .
Sometimes you can create you with that .
Ah . It 's ready .
<unk> , of course , you can turn in a problem , but we have a solution .
So here you can see how it looks like the damage in this material .
It 's a <unk> , like I said , so it 's only a little amount of <unk> between the stones .
Because of the time , to the mountains , to Lagos , this <unk> , this <unk> , the glue between the <unk> , and if you get it , and if you get it up , they will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
So , if you drive through the road , you 'll get the <unk> -- like we saw here .
To solve this problem , we think about <unk> materials .
If we can do this material , then we probably have a solution .
So what we can do it is using steel <unk> , from that for <unk> <unk> , and we can cut up the steel of steel in very small , and we can make these little pieces with the <unk> .
So we 've got up with a little pieces of steel of steel in him .
Then you need a machine , as you see here , you use it to help -- a machine machine .
They can breathe , especially steel , it 's very good in that .
So what you 've got to do is the steel , <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> by these <unk> , and the <unk> is going back to the surface .
Today , I used to use a tumor , because I ca n't get the big machine machine here to the stage .
It 's a symbol system .
I put the shows , I 'm going to take you to see what happened .
This is the shows that it comes now .
I said , we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab for the arts .
We took a lot there and then the government , we actually saw our results , and thought , `` Well , that 's very interesting . We have to try . ''
So , we had a piece of road , 400 feet from the <unk> <unk> , where we had to make a cup of trial to give this material .
So that was what we did there . You see where we were doing the test test , and then , of course , this road spent a few years without any damage . That 's what we know about practice .
We took a lot of samples of this road and we try in the lab .
We made the cell , we put a lot of them in them , and then with our machine machine , and then it 's going to make it and then we put it .
We can do this many times .
Well , to conclude , to conclude , I can tell you that we 've done a material using steel or <unk> these malaria , using the energy energy , in reality , increase the life from the road , even you can increase the life of the road , you can even save the life of the road .
And now , of course , you have curiosity if this was also working .
We have the show here . It 's pretty hot .
In fact , you have to explain it up to the first before I can show you how to show you how to show you how it does .
But I 'm going to do a attempt .
Let 's see . Yes , worked .
Thank you .
When I was 11 years ago , I remember , I remember a morning with the <unk> sound in my house .
My father was listening up in your little radio radio radio .
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times , because the news are not going to be .
`` The Taliban were ! `` I took my father .
I did n't know what , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
`` OK , you can go to a school school , he said .
One morning I never forget .
One of the truth .
You 'll see , I had six years ago when the Taliban came up to <unk> , and they made it illegal that girls were to school .
On the next five years , I 'll be <unk> as a child for <unk> my family sister , which I could n't be able to be outside , to go to a secret school .
It was the only way that the two we could get it .
Every day , you 'll create a different route for a different route for no thing to do where we were .
We had to teach the books in the market for the market that would be able to go on .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us a little room .
It was nice in the winter , but extremely born in summer .
All of all we knew that our lives -- the teacher , students and our parents .
At when , in when it 's a few school per week , because the Taliban left .
We always wondered what they knew them .

Do you know where we live ?
We were <unk> , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters .
My grandfather was a extraordinary man for their time .
And a half of a total of a high <unk> of Afghanistan , <unk> in that his daughter , my mother , outside school and so that his father 's <unk> .
But my mother would come up .
This is it .
He took a few years ago , just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood .
And my father , this is , was the first of all their family in having education .
There was no doubt that their children had to get education , even their daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was a biggest risk in not pay their children .
For the years of the Taliban , I remember that I was very excited about our life , and I was always afraid and do n't see a future .
I wanted to take , but my father said , `` <unk> , daughter , you can lose everything that you have in life .
You can take your money . You can take your house for a war .
But there 's a thing that I always be to be with you , what 's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your blood education , we 'll do .
So , you do n't want to continue ? ''
I have 17 years ago .
I grew up in a country that has been trained for decades .
Many of the six percent of the women of my age have more than the school , and if my family did n't have been so interested with my education , I would be one of them .
In climate change , I found here proud of <unk> in <unk> .
When I came to Afghanistan , my grandfather , which was <unk> from his home for their daughters , it was one of the first in the first .
He did n't only get out of my National title , but also that I was the first woman , and I 'm the first woman , which I 'm going to put up by the streets of Darfur .
My family think of me .
I sleep in big , but my family has still more large dreams for me .
It 's why I 'm the global advent of <unk> , a global campaign to move to women .
It 's why <unk> <unk> , the first , and maybe the only high school school for girls in Afghanistan , a country in which it 's still prepared for girls go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong desire to make the opportunity .
And I see their parents and their families that , as the mine , <unk> by them , despite them and even in front of a real choice .
It 's not the real name , and I ca n't show you their face , but I ca n't show you their face , but he 's called the father of one of my students .
A less than a month , he and his daughter would come back from <unk> to their village , and literally , it 's all about being killed by a bomb in the road , for minutes .
When you go to her home , they are the phone , a voice would tell you that if he ended up to her daughter to school , we 'll try to try .
`` <unk> , if you want to , '' he said , `` But not the future of my daughter for your old daughter , and they get ideas . ''
So what I 've found in Afghanistan , and it 's something that 's often often close in the West , is that behind most of the people who are born , there 's a parent that they cut the value of his daughter , and you see it 's success from her own success .
I do n't mean that our mothers do n't have been key to our success .
In fact , often are the first <unk> <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters , but in the context of a society as we Afghanistan , we need the support of men .
In the Taliban , the girls who were to school , the girls who were thinking about hundreds of -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , over three billion girls are going to school in Afghanistan .
We see so different from here in the U.S. .
I show you that Americans see the impact of changes .
You know that these changes do n't get a lot of , after the <unk> of the United States .
But when I go back to Afghanistan , when I look at the students in my school , and the parents who would get them for them , that you can see a <unk> future and an change change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities , and every day the girls 's girls told me .
Like me , they 're going to go in big .
Thank you .
I never know the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> , `` You know , I 'm going to breathe .
But you 'll never go back to you , it 's going to go up . ''
They 've been a almost two years since the revolution <unk> , and by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , so much of the <unk> revolution .
One of the forces with many other citizens <unk> , inside the country to call a day , and begin a revolution to call a revolution against the <unk> .
And we did , it was a big revolution .
They come up and men young young men were in the top of the <unk> , and then the <unk> of the <unk> , we get out of freedom , dignity and social justice .
They have shown a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They have shown a great sense of deforestation from the Middle East , until the West , until the South .
Finally , after a few months of six months of war , and a little set of set out of about 50 thousand thousand thousand , we 'll get putting our country and send it to the interest .
And yet , we 'll go back to a whole way , a whole legacy , the physical legacy , corruption and seeds .
For a four decades , the regime would be able to put the infrastructure , the culture and the moral structure of society .
Now , of the <unk> and of the challenges , I 'm going to go back to a lot of women , to build the civil society , to create civil society , and it 's not going to be able to democracy and it 's not going to democracy .
It 's a lot of 200 organizations in <unk> , and then later after the each of Cambridge .
After a period of a few years of Caltech , I went back to Libya , and with a single thing , I started able to organize it into the development of capabilities , and skills of leadership .
With a incredible group of women , we 've got a incredible group of <unk> <unk> , a movement , a movement of women , leaders , in the <unk> of the <unk> of the woman , and by the <unk> of agriculture 's building .
I found with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> , a environment that was every more <unk> , which is <unk> from the political policies of Islam and freedom .
With the time , our mom was taken up and successful .
The women put a <unk> percent of the National Congress in the first elections in Britain .
But yet , a little bit of the team and the revolution , and the revolution like a everything , they were disappearing , all the days of violence .
A day , we go up with the news of the <unk> <unk> , and unfortunately .
Another day , <unk> with the news of the <unk> , and the attack the <unk> .
Another day we read with the news from the army of the army .
And every day , every day , we go up with the government 's government , and their ancestors would lose the human rights of the plants and their lack of respect of the law .
Our society , they made by a bit of it , it 's <unk> , and it has from the limits and principles of freedom , dignity , dignity , we had the beginning .
You know , the appearance , and they became the president of the consequences of the revolution .
I 'm not here today in all of us with our story of the success of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the election .
And so I 'm here today to tell you that , as a nation , we 'll make bad , we take the wrong decision .
They do n't do well .
Because children do n't get peace , and the <unk> and security .
And the list of <unk> and the <unk> between investors , and they brought it to peace and national television ?
No , they did n't do .
What happened ?
Why is our society , and they were born with political policies , and interestingly , so as men like women ?
Maybe it was not only women , but the biggest values of compassion , unfortunately and complex .
Our society needs the national perspective , and the creation of <unk> , that they needed the choice , which just would be able to be able to put it up and the performance .
Our nation needs to the <unk> representation of the most most thing to be able to be able to think of the <unk> , and they get it from it .
We need to make you to act as they were able to call them from the <unk> , and I 'll call the day .
We need to start to act like compassion .
We have to develop a <unk> speech , which is not only <unk> , but it 's also going to do in practice , but it 's also going to do it in practice , the collaboration in place , the collaboration in place .
These are the <unk> that a dimension , because of the war , needs to be built with the end of the peace .
Because peace has a way that 's about the Himalayas and the <unk> between the <unk> , and the risks .
That 's the real <unk> .
We need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
You know , with a <unk> of the Koran , the peace -- the peace -- `` It 's the word of the God .
At time , the word `` <unk> , '' who 's known in all the <unk> traditions , it has the same root in China that the word `` <unk> . ''
And so , at the way , the <unk> is completely the <unk> , which moves inside , the <unk> <unk> of compassion , all the existence .
So , it says , `` My proposal is all of things . ''
So , he says , `` My proposal would go on my anger . ''
That 's going to do all of the sensitivity of wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm here today to tell you about a true question , which has an answer response .
It 's about the secrets of violence , and the question I 'm going to address is the question that you do n't always know , why is it ?
Why would you have someone to go with a man who would happen ?
No , I 'm not saying , no social fiction , not in violence in violence .
I just am a woman with a story that I tell .
I was 17 years ago , I was born in the University of Harvard .
I had to go to New York for my first work as a <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first <unk> <unk> , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that many , a lot of times , the man , which I showed my soul , I 'm going to put it to the head with a gun , you 'll give them with the <unk> .
The man , when I loved more than a single one in this world , put a gun in my head , and I 'll be able to go back with more times that I can remember .
I 'm here to tell you the story of `` No love . ''
I could be their story .
I do n't look like a typical <unk> of violence .
I 'm <unk> in English University , and I have a <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
I 've spent the most part of my career working on the list of the list of the list of the list of a hundred '' '' between these Johnson , <unk> <unk> , and the Washington student .
I 've been almost 20 years ago with my second husband and have three children .
My dog is a black <unk> , and I 'm a <unk> <unk> .
So my first message for you , is that violence 's violence can go to anyone , all the sex , all of the <unk> , all the levels of income and education .
It 's everywhere .
And my second message is that you all think that violence 's violence on women , which is a problem of women .
Not exactly .
60 percent of the <unk> are men , and the poverty are only men in relationships , especially and long , or , in the families , the last place where we would want to find , or we should find violence ; why , it 's going to find violence .
I would have said that it would be the last person in the world that was looking at with a man who would come up with a man who would take it , and I made it a very typical teacher because of my age .
I was 22 years ago , and in the United States , the women in 16 and 24 years old , you have three times more likely to be victims of being victims of violence , and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year , and more than 500 women and girls .
I also went to a typical teacher because I did n't know about violence , their signals or their patterns .
I met the <unk> in a cold , and I looked back from January .
I was sitting at my hand in New York and started <unk> me with me .
He said two things .
The first was that he also had a <unk> from a university , and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street .
But what I was going to me in that first find was that he was ready and fun , and that seemed like a kid .
And I had a lot of <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> hair , and it seemed so metaphor .
One of the most smart things that did <unk> , from the beginning , it was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner .
He made it on all at the beginning of <unk> .
We started to come back , and I loved everything of me : I was a list , who had gone to Harvard , who would put passion in help girls , and my work .
I wanted to know about my family , my childhood , my dreams and pain .
<unk> thought of me , as a woman , as a woman , as nobody had never done .
And it was why I looked at that , in that childhood school and the work in Wall Street and their brilliant future had a big importance for him .
I did n't know that the first phase in any relationship of violence , it 's going to come up and <unk> the victim .
And I did n't know that the second step is <unk> .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was , I wanted to do it was , in New York , and let 's leave the work of my dreams , but I thought that I had to do , and I thought I had to do , and I thought I had to do it , and I was <unk> and I went together together .
I did n't have no idea that I was coming up in a <unk> `` No love . ''
The next step in the pattern of violence is to be able to introduce the threat of violence to see how it goes up .
And here is where they go on the <unk> .
In the way , we went to New Zealand , you know , that website where they 're supposed to be able to feel so sure , I 'm going to feel so sure .
I was in the <unk> of the car .
One one would go under the pillow in our bed and the third always in their pocket .
And he said , I needed those <unk> to cause the monkeys that lived from small .
I needed to feel sure .
But those events actually were a message for me , and even though I never got the hand , my life was not very serious , every minute every day .
The first attack of the <unk> , we spent five days before our wedding .
They were the seven of the morning , and I still had the <unk> .
Five days later , when the 10 percent of my neck had gone up , I put my neck , I put my mother .
In spite of what I had happened , I was sure that they were happy to be always happy , because I loved , and he also loved it , and he also wanted me .
And I was very , very going .
I just had a very <unk> sense for the day , and by the fact of being a family .
There was a <unk> accident , and I 'll never do it .
I spent two times more in our honey moon .
The first time I was sitting into a secret beach and I lost , and he gave me so strong in the head that we 've got several times against the car .
And then , a couple of days later , we 'll go back from our <unk> moon , you 'll be able to get up by the traffic , and I gave me a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , or two times per week for the next week and half of our marriage .
I 'll tell you when I thought was the only in this situation .
One of every three women , American women is director of violence , or based in some moment of their life , and the Nobel Center of 2030 that every year 15 billion children are born , 15 million .
So , actually , it was very good company .
Let 's go back to my question : why did me ?
The answer is simple .
I did n't know that he was going to me .
At the opposite , I was a very strong woman , I put out of a very strong man , and it was the only person in the world that I could help it to be able to be able to tell you to deal with their house .
The other question that all the world does is , why do n't not go ?
Why I did n't me ? I could have been in any moment .
To me , this is the most sad question , and unfortunately that people do , because of us , the victims , we know something that normally you .
Because the last phase in the pattern of violence .
More than 70 percent of the <unk> in cases of violence , so after the victim , then that the victim is going to move to the relationship , after you , because then the <unk> does n't have nothing to lose .
Other neurons can be able to find the permanent dimension , even after the <unk> is going to get up , <unk> , <unk> resources , and <unk> of the <unk> system for <unk> to the victim and their children , they normally are invented for the judges to go to the victim and their children , who are n't invented by the judges .
And so we 're still wondering why it does n't happen ?
I was able to be able to go , to cause from one last <unk> , I 'll be able to say my alphabet .
I realized that the man that I loved so much , I would have to get it , if you would have it .
So I was the silence .
He told us all the world : the police , to my neighbors , to my friends and family , and I 'm here today , and I 'm here today because of you .
We 've got the trend to <unk> the victims as the headlines , women , women , goods .
The question , `` Why is it ? ''
And for some people , it 's a way to say , `` The fault is you going to stop , '' like if the victims would be able to go up .
But since I was from that I was going to say , `` Wow , '' I 've heard some of stories of men and women who also forget , who learned a lesson from what we 've got to be , and they get their lives lives and happy and happy and mothers , lives and mothers , lives and mothers .
Because it turns out that I 'm a victim and a <unk> of violence very typical .
I was going to be able to be able to be a beautiful man , and so we have those three children .
I have that black black , and also that <unk> .
What I 'm not going to go back to have never going to have not more , you know , it 's a prize to tell my head in the hands of somebody who says I want to .
In this moment , as you 're thinking , `` <unk> , that 's fascinating ! '' or `` <unk> , `` <unk> , `` <unk> , `` <unk> , `` You know , I 've been talking about you .
I assure you that there 's a few people , that you 're going to tell you right now , they 're going to be coming up or that they were from a little or that they are <unk> .
The <unk> could be cut to his daughter , to his sister , to your best friend right now .
I was able to put the end of my personal love love the silence .
And I do n't do today .
It 's my way to help other victims , and it 's my last sign to you .
They 've heard of what you 've heard here .
The victims are only in the silence .
They have the power of looking at the violence to be just able to get light on it .
The victims we need to all the world .
We need to each of you understand the secrets of violence .
Let 's take the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children , their colleagues , their friends and family .
You 'll get their view of the <unk> , as a great people , they have a whole future .
We 'll get the signs of violence in violence , to bring it up , and to show her their light and show them to the victims of a safe .
Together , we can be able to turn our clothes , our monkeys and our families in the <unk> and necessary they should be .
Thank you .
Hi . I call it surgery , and from a time , I 'm a model .
To be , from 10 years ago .
And I feel that in this moment , there 's a terrible <unk> in the room because I should n't have been done , so well , I 've got my clothes to happen .
This is the first change change in a TED stage , so you have a lot of <unk> , I think .
If some of the women , they were able to get it , you do n't have to get it , but I can find it , but I wanted to find it back in Twitter .
I also want to point that I have the privilege to change what I think about me in so 10 seconds .
Not all the world has that opportunity .
These guys are very happy ; less than I do n't have to use it .
The worst part of it is going to go to this map for the head , because it 's when you 're going to talk about me , so you do n't do anything as I 'm going to do anything as it 's the head .
All right .
Why do you do this ?
It 's been invented .
Well , I hope that I do n't like this picture .
The appearance is powerful , but also also .
I 've changed what I thought about me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I 've never had a book in life life .
I was absolutely terrible and the photographer told me that I 'm going to go back to the back and <unk> the hair .
Of course , except with surgery or a artificial performance as I 've made it two days for the work , there 's very little that we can do to transform our future , which is very little that we can do to transform our lives .
So today , for me , it will be hard means to be honest .
I 'm in this stage because I 'm model .
And because I 'm a beautiful woman and white sector , and in my own sector , that 's being a beautiful girl .
I 'm going to answer the questions that people always do me , but in the way .
The first question is , how is going to be a model ?
And I always say , `` A <unk> gave me , but that does n't mean anything .
The true reason why I 've made me model is because he won the <unk> , and I 'm the one of a program , and maybe you 're asking what it 's this program .
Well , in the last centuries , we do n't only know the beauty as health , young and symmetry and symmetry , which we 're fortunate to be able to go back , we also see it to a high and <unk> skin , and it 's a white skin .
And that 's my heritage , we suspect I 've been able to make money .
And I know that there are people in the public that now shows you know , and maybe there 's some of some <unk> , and maybe there 's some <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
In the first place , the <unk> to know so much of models . It 's amazing .
But yet I have to tell you that in 2007 , a student student in the University of New York said , and every one of the models of models in the road , and from the <unk> models , only 27 , is saying , less than four percent , they were n't white .
The next question that people always do is , we 're going to be a model when it 's more ?
And my first answer is : I do n't know , I do n't know that .
But then , what I 'm going to say to each of these girls is , why ? You can be what you want .
You can be president of the United States , or the <unk> of the next Internet , or a <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> , which would be amazing , you know the first .
If you were from this strange list , still , no , no , no , <unk> , I want to be model , then I say , I know my grandmother .
Because I 'm not going to come out of nothing , and you could be the <unk> , and you could be the friend of a half of the American magazine , or the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or the next <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes that 's going to be model is like to say you want to win the reaction when you 're more .
It 's about your control , it 's amazing , and it 's not a work that you can choose .
I 'm going to show you all what I learned in 10 years as model , because of the <unk> surgery , it can be able to be able to be done right now .
I do n't know what happened there .
Unfortunately , once you 've got to look at your studies , and you have to have a <unk> and a few jobs to your hands , you do n't matter what you say , is , if you said , if you know , if you know , if you know , if you know , if you know , if you know , if you know , if
The next question that people always know me is if all the pictures are <unk> .
And I know , you know , you know all the pictures , but that 's just a little part of what happens .
This was the first picture that I got , and also the first time that used to use a view , and I could n't even have my period .
Yes , we 're going on in the personal , but it was a child .
So I started my grandmother a few months earlier .
These two pictures are the same day .
My friend came with me .
So here I 'm in a <unk> party a few days before the photographs for the <unk> <unk> .
Here I 'm with my team team and in the magazine magazine .
And this is I in the way .
And I hope to realize that I 'm not in those pictures .
They 're from a group of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , South and <unk> , and all of their <unk> and people and and they 're going to create this .
Well , the next question , the next question that people always know me is : <unk> things ?
I have a lot of <unk> in 20 hours , and they never use , except the couple of , but the privilege that I get in the real life , and that we do n't like to talk .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I went to a store , and I forgot to take money , and they gave me to take a free .
When I was a teenager , I ended up with my friend who was a <unk> , they 've got a sunlight in red and , of course , we came up , and I 'll get a little thing to be able to go back .
I 'll take them from these privilege for my way , not why I am , and there 's people who 's a price for their matter , not matter who are .
I live in New York , and the last year , of the <unk> <unk> to the ones that I 've got to have to come and then came up , 86 percent were black , and most of them were young men .
And there 's only <unk> young young young young young black , and in New York , why for them , is not a question of me ?
But about how many times I 'm going to do ?
And when this talk for this talk , I realized that by 45 percent of the eight years in the United States I do n't like their body , and that 's that number it turned up to 60 percent .
So , the last question that people do is : How is the life of a model ?
And I think the answer that you 're going to be : If you 're a little bit more and you have the smaller hair , you want to make very happy and it .
And behind the cameras , you give a answer that maybe it looks like .
We say , it 's really amazing to travel , and also amazing power to work with creative people , but it 's also .
And all that 's true , but it 's just a part of what happens , because what you do n't tell you in front of the cameras , what I 've never said in front of them , is , I 'm true .
And I 'm because I have to try for my point every day .
And if you have a few legs , with a little legs and the most brilliant , being more happy ?
They just have to come up with a group of models , because they have the more <unk> legs , the most brilliant , the more brilliant , and the biggest women , but they probably get the women , they probably get the women .
But about everything , it was hard to put a situation , and from gender when I 'm one of the biggest <unk> .
If there 's something that I 'm going to think about this talk , I hope that all of the most comfortable thing to recognize the power of the image of the image that we have from success and failure .
Thank you .
The photograph has been my passion from which was the biggest enough to put a camera , but I know , I want to share with you with you , I want to share with you , I want to share with you .
There was not a sudden , no <unk> , not chance to do the pictures , not even a good way in the ceiling .
In fact , most of them , most of them .
My story begins when , <unk> in the city of New York , to give you a stage , my wife was taken to me this picture of my daughter in the day of his first birthday . That 's the corner of spades and five .
He came up to put in New York just a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well , you know what it comes now .
When you see the third birthday of my daughter , my wife said , why do n't you give you to <unk> in New York in a journey , and you 'll get it on the project ?
Here 's when we started to ask the unless they were going to get us the picture .
It 's amazing that I 'm going to be able to take the camera to a really universal .
They have never heard and , fortunately , never no one has <unk> with the camera .
So , we were n't aware of how much we would change life that journey .
It became a <unk> for us .
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> , and I had to explain to my daughter who had happened to my daughter , what I could understand .
These pictures are a lot more than a lot of a short moment or a negative journey .
They 're also a way to stop the time in a week , and we 'll tell you think about our time and our evolution over the years of years , and not only in the physical level , but not only in the senses .
Because , even though we always put the same picture , our perspective change , my daughter , my daughter , and I can see life through their eyes and how you get and interact with everything .
That time we spend together is something that we 've got together with illusion all the year .
I was born , in one of the 1970s , we were walking up , and when suddenly , they got to go on a cold , and a signal , a red <unk> of the tent who was a little bit of a lot of a day .
And I realized what there was a sense of five years in the same place .
You know , <unk> their heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time nine years ago .
And now what it looks at New York , they are community , because it 's starting to study in New York .
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories .
So , I want to share the idea of participate in the human creation .
I do n't know , but after these 15 pictures , I do n't read in a lot of the family pictures .
I 'm always going to take the picture .
Today , I want you to tell you to come back on the picture , and they do n't have to be able to ask someone and ask you , we get a picture ?
Thank you .
I want to talk to talk about a very special group of animals .
There 's 10 of the birds in the world .
They were able to find the group of birds .
In the first place , why have a bad press ?
It 's also based out with the <unk> things like <unk> characters , stupid , bad .
More recently , if you have been able to put the press <unk> , and I got the <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that we do with the <unk> , but I do n't know it .
I do n't know . You know why ?
Because the members of them do n't get the environment , the <unk> not help by prevent the disease of disease .
You 're going to go up . They 're too far . And , my favorite , you have to be better .
There 's the <unk> of the New War that you find in the West , like the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the United States , and we have 16 species .
So , why do you think about it are important ? In the first place , they have different services .
They are our ability of natural warming .
<unk> the neighbors to the bone .
They 're going to support all of the bacteria , they 'll try to get the emphasis that they do n't be by them , and it 's a big set of <unk> and disease in other animals .
Now , the recent Bang have shown that in areas where there 's not , they 're going to take it , they 're going to take three to four times more time in the <unk> , and this has huge variation in the disease of disease .
They also have huge importance .
They have been associated with the old culture culture .
<unk> was the symbol of the T and the shoulder and , and then , on it , and then , on the unit between the phone , and the <unk> of Egypt .
In the <unk> dimension , <unk> was the god <unk> , and he took their life to save the <unk> of the beach of 10 head .
In the <unk> culture , you 're going to have a very important thing to put a open sky , in places like Antarctica , there 's not no place to play the dead , or wood for <unk> , so that these leads to make a system system .
What is the problem with you ?
We have eight species in Kenya in Kenya , which six are in the top of the objective .
The reason is that they 're being going to be , and the reason that they 're going to be able to be , is because there 's conflicts between humans and animal . The communities are used to use this place against innovation , and as a consequence , the <unk> are victims of this .
In South Asia , in countries as India and Pakistan , four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction , which means that in less about 10 or 15 years ago , and the reason it means that in least 10 or 15 .
This drug has been able to use in India , and they 've taken one of it .
As you do n't know , there 's been a represents in the number of dogs , the <unk> of dogs , and when you have dogs dogs , it has a huge bank of time to come on . The number of cases has gone up in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest national parks in Africa : <unk> <unk> is going to be a cold .
I 'm not against energy energy , but we have to work with the governments , because the creation is going to be doing this to the birds .
They are <unk> .
In Africa , there 's a little bit of <unk> , they 're all a little bit of <unk> , they 're going to get the <unk> and the market market .
So what 's doing ? Well , we 're trying to these birds . We 're looking at them .
We 're trying to determine their basic , and see where they go .
We can see it in different countries , so we spend in a problem , not going to do anything .
We have to work with the governments in urban levels .
We 're working with the local communities .
We 're talking about them to think about it , about the need to see these wonderful creatures and the services they get .
Can you help ? It may become assets , to do noise . You can write a letter to his government and tell you , we have to focus in these very <unk> , and you 'll tell you we have to focus on these very real creatures .
When you go from this room , you 'll tell you about it , but you talk to their families , with their children , with their children on it .
They 're very nervous . Charles Luther said that it changed , because they saw it to fly without effort , not in energy in the climate .
Kenya , this world , it will be a lot more on these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
Every thing I 'm going to go , and everything I do , and all of what I do .
And since I went back to ask it . It 's young , but I 'm not going to go back in Zambia , Kenya , <unk> and Somalia .
I worked for a pencil , and every project that we built in Africa .
And I was born .
I thought , at the winter , that we had all good people and we were doing a good job in Africa .
In place in place , everything that we 've got to get it .
Our first project , which inspired my first book , `` <unk> of the <unk> , '' was a project in where a few weeks I decided to teach people to teach the people to move food .
So , we 've got with seeds to the south of Delhi to this absolutely absolutely magic thing that goes into the river <unk> , and we teach the local forests , and we teach the local forests and <unk> , and ...
Of course , people were not in all interested in to do that , why I 'm going to be able to come to work , and some of them , they do n't go .
Now , in the time , I 'm going to ask you how it was possible to do anything , we just said , `` Well , God we 're here . ''
And of course , everything in Africa , it feels .
And we got these <unk> <unk> . In Italy , a pencil to be on this size .
And we do n't know , we were saying to the <unk> , `` Look what easy is the agriculture . ''
When they were a lot of them , and there was red , from the night in night in the morning , about 200 <unk> came from the river , and they get all all . And we said to the <unk> , `` God , the <unk> . ''
And the <unk> said , `` Yes , why we do n't have agriculture here . ''
I thought , I was just told them to fight in Africa , but then , I saw what they made the Americans , what they did the French , what they did the French , and then you see what they were doing , I felt quite proud of my project in Zambia .
Because , as you see , at least the <unk> .
We 'll be able to see the cost -- you 'll be able to see the plants that we 're going to get to the <unk> of Africa .
It wants to read a book , I read `` <unk> , '' '' <unk> <unk> .
The book was born in 2009 .
And then , countries , countries , we 've brought to the African continent two billion dollars in the last 50 billion dollars in the last 50 years .
I do n't tell you about the damage that the money has been built .
I just read his book .
<unk> from a half woman , the damage we 've done .
The Western we are intrigued , and we try to be <unk> , and we try to people just just two ways : or they are it <unk> .
The two words come from the <unk> , `` <unk> , '' which means `` father . ''
Yet , it means two things .
<unk> , I 'm trying to anyone from a different culture as if they were my children . ''
<unk> , I 'm trying to all the one of a different culture as if they were to get my amygdala .
So the white in Africa are called `` <unk> . ''
And that book gave me a sister in the face , `` The little is beautiful , '' written by <unk> , who said by the economic development , if people do n't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
This is the first beginning of help .
The first end of the help is .
This morning , the man who was taken this conference in the floor , and he said , you can give you , you imagine a city that does n't be <unk> ? ''
I decided to the 27 years , only to tell people , and it invented a system called <unk> <unk> <unk> where you 've never done anything , you do n't have no one , you do n't have no one , you do n't have no one , but it becomes one of the local passion , the ideal of the local people who have the dream of a
So , what ?
It 's going to go to a community with a idea , and it gets up with the people of the spider .
We do n't work from the offices .
We put it in a coffee , we came back in a <unk> .
We have no infrastructure .
And what we do ? We put it in friends , and we understood what the person wants to do .
The most important thing is the passion .
You can give you a idea to someone .
If that person do n't want to do that , what do you do .
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that the man has for their own social growth is the most important thing .
And then , we 'll help find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can have successful .
The person with the idea you can not have knowledge , but knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : why do n't us , for one time to get to the way to tell people what do n't tell people what do n't , why do n't , for one time , we hear it ?
I 'll tell you a secret .
There 's a problem with the meetings .
The entrepreneurs never come up , and they would never tell you , in a public meeting , what you want to do with their own money , what could opportunity .
So , the peace has this blind point .
Now , the most smart people from their community , you do n't even know , because they do n't know the point , because they do n't go to their meetings .
What do we do ? We work one of you , and we 've got a face to face , you have to create a social infrastructure , which does n't exist .
You should create a new profession .
The profession is the medical doctor of the company , the medical doctor of the business , which is taught with you in your house , in the table of his kitchen , and they realize to find the resources to transform their passion in a way to transform their passion in a way .
I started this as a test test , city in rural Australia .
I was doing a Ph.D. in the time , trying to be able to get out of this mountains in which we got to tell you what do it .
In a year , I had 27 projects in the end , and the government gave me to see , `` How can you do that ?
How can you do it ? '' And I said , `` I did something very , very hard .
I came up and I heard . '' And then , then the government says , `` How we 've done in 300 communities in the world .
We 've helped to start 40 business .
There 's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of condoms .
Peter <unk> , one of the more likely , you know , you know , a lot of the story of the story , he came to the snow , a few years ago .
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before you live in business , and this is what he says , `` Life is in reality with a society , and a economy 's reality , ''
It is the <unk> of the modern spirit .
So now , I 'm going to be able to be able to be able to know what the more <unk> people would want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn to get these people to do with you .
You have to give you a sense , privacy , has to be great to help you , and then it 's going to be able to help them , a mass .
In a community of 10 people , we spend 200 customers .
You can imagine a community of 400 people , intelligence and passion ?
What would you show you , you 've got more this morning ?
People local and local government .
So , what I 'm going to tell you is that the 1984 spirit is where it 's .
We 're at the end of the first revolution of industrial revolution <unk> plants , or a thousand times , and from a moment to another , we have systems that are not .
It 's not sustainable .
And the <unk> as a way , it 's not sustainable .
What we have to think , it 's how to <unk> , it 's how <unk> , we do , we 're able to be able to protect seven billion people , in a sustainable way .
There 's not the technologies to do it .
Who 's going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? The universities ?
The government ?
They have the entrepreneurs and they are doing now .
There 's a little story that you 've got a few magazine , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were known to study the future of New York in the year .
And in the year , you know this group of people , and I 'll get it out about what happened to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was <unk> : The city of New York did n't live in 100 years .
Why ? Because it 's going to go to the curve , and they said , if the population are going to move to this rate , to move to the population of New York in the neighborhood , we 've got six billion , and the one produced for six billion , and the gas produced for six million .
They were all <unk> in Santa , so much , they were <unk> this great technology that <unk> life in New York .
So , what happens ?
And the idea of finding a different technology , it was absolutely idealistic , and there was very few , <unk> in places .
<unk> , Virginia Ford .
But yet , there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to give you .
On the other way , you do n't get to talk about you .
And then , you have to give you a all , it 's a little bit .
And eventually , you 'll have to tell you the truth with it .
The more small company , the biggest company has to be able to be able to do three things : the product you want to sell it to be great , you have to tell you with a fantastic violence , you have to tell you with a fantastic administration .
Do you know what ?
We 've been known to a only human being in the world that can do , they sell and look at the money only .
Not there .
This is still not born .
We 've launched it , and he looked at the 100 companies of the European world , you know , Ford , Ford , Ford Ford , all of the new companies , Google .
There 's only one thing that all of companies are happening in the world have in common , only one : no one : No , it was a single person .
I 'll give you the word `` I '' , but the word `` ourselves , '' 32 times .
He was not only when he started .
No one begins a company only .
So , we can create the community where we 've got to explain , who come from a small environment , who come from a little business environment in the <unk> , in Harvard , and then , what someone did this gentleman who talk about this gentleman who talk about this gentleman who talk about this man who talks about it .
What can you do you ? You can do it ?
OK , you can stop ? You can look at the money ? ''
`` Oh , I ca n't do that . ''
We built communities .
Thank you .
People can help us help their lives .
We do n't know all the neighbors , so we do n't know a lot of knowledge to even share the same public spaces .
In the last years I 've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space , with simple tools like <unk> , etc. .
These projects came from questions like , how how do you get my neighbors by their windows ?
How can we fly and ask the more things without call the door in a bad moment ?
How do I share more than our <unk> buildings and understanding better our landscape ?
How do I share more of our hopes to the <unk> shops for our communities can be able to do today our needs and dreams ?
I live in New York , and I 'm born in New York .
My soul , you always find with the autonomous <unk> that you give you .
And they always talk about the music , there 's a <unk> in New York City , the city has one of the most beautiful of the world , but also one with the biggest amount of properties of the United States .
I live about this house , and I thought how you could take it in a more nice space for the neighborhood , and also in something that changed my life .
In 2009 , I lost someone who loved a lot .
It was obvious , as a mother for me .
Their death was <unk> and <unk> .
I thought a lot of death .
And this was a deep thing for the living time .
And he gave the whole things of my life .
But I 'll be able to keep it in my life in my life life .
I mean , it 's easy to be able to get through the day , and forget the really important thing for one .
So , with the help of old and new friends had the wall of this home house in a giant desert , and then I 'd come back on her risk to come out , `` Before I want to do . ''
So , they could take a chalk , think about their lives and share special complex in public space .
I did n't know what about this experiment , but at the next day , I was going to go back , and I kept <unk> .
And I 'd like to share some things that people wrote in the wall .
`` Before they 'll die , `` Before , I want to be in Twitter . ''
`` Before I want to sing for millions of people . ''
`` Before I want to use a tree . ''
`` Before I want to live from the network . ''
`` Before I want to give you a time . ''
`` Before I 'm going to go to the person of somebody . ''
`` Before I want to be completely . ''
So this space , we 're taken up , and the dreams and scientists , and they share the people and share of people made me , I 'm going to say , and I gave me , and they gave me it in moments .
It 's about to know that one is not only . It 's about to understand our neighbors of new ways and <unk> . It 's about to give us the most important thing for us , and they 'll remember what 's the most important thing for us as we grow and change .
This happened last year and I started to get hundreds of messages from people who wanted to make a wall in their community .
That 's why with my colleagues in the middle center we made a call and now have been done in countries in all the world , as opposed , South South Africa , Australia , Australia , and more there .
With the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to do and share each other .
Two of the most moral things we have are the time and our relationships with other people .
In our age , it 's more important to never , to find the ways to explain the perspective and remember that life is very short and spiritual .
The death is something of what we 're often going to talk about , or even thinking , but I decided to think of it , but I understood that it 's a one of those things that we 'll do more power .
You think about the death of our life .
Our spaces , they can be able to be able to be able to make us as individuals and as a community and with more media to share scientists , fears and stories , people who can be able to help us to improve places , can help us improve our lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Today I have a only sign .
Please do n't tell me that I 'm a normal .
Now I 'd like to introduce to my brothers .
<unk> has 17 years ago , it 's very high and very successful .
You do n't talk about , but they feel better than some of the best speakers .
<unk> knows what 's the love .
And what it comes up to happen what happens .
It 's not <unk> . You do n't look at the color of the skin .
You do n't know the <unk> differences and look at this : there 's never available .
When I got the songs of our childhood , trying to tell the words of the ones that I do n't even have me , I reminds me a thing : I reminds me a thing : what we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that 's going to be .
A 16 has 16 years ago . It 's high .
They have the memory memory .
Yet , it 's a emotional memory .
I do n't know if I woke up my <unk> , but reminds the year that came up every one of the songs of my iPod , conversations who would put it when I had four years ago , you do n't ask them in my arm for the first epidemic of the <unk> and the birthday of 2030 .
Is n't really amazing ?
But most of people do n't know .
And , in fact , because their minds does n't be able to the concept of least society , often are often <unk> and <unk> .
But what I put to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case , even if you do n't mean , that would only mean , that would only mean one thing : I could only mean one thing : I was extraordinary and extraordinary .
Now , for those less familiar with the term `` autism , '' is a complex of brain that affects social communication , learning and sometimes to sometimes the physical skills .
In every individual , it 's a different way , from there , which is so different to us .
And in all the world , every 20 minutes , you 've been interested a new case of autism , and if it 's one of the development of the development that most fast change in the world , there 's no cause no cure .
I do n't know about my first find with autism , but I do n't remember one one day without him .
I had just three years when my brother came to the world , and I was very excited to have a new being in my life .
When he got a few months ago , I realized that he was different .
<unk> .
I did n't want to play as the other babies and , in fact , not very interested in me in all .
<unk> lived and put in their own world , with their own rules , and I found pleasure in the most small things , like to put the cars in line around the room , looking at the machine and eat anything that was between <unk> .
As it turned up , it 's going to go more different , and the differences are going to do more .
But beyond the <unk> , the competition and the <unk> , there was a really only one : a simple nature that looked at the world without a kid , a human , a human being that there was no human .
Child .
I do n't know that there has been some hard moments in my family , moments in the ones that would be able to try that they were just like me .
But I look back to the things that I 've taught , and the communication and the love and the love , and I realize that it 's things I do n't want to change .
It 's less about the beauty that you give us the differences , and the fact of being different does n't mean that there 's wrong .
It just means that there 's a different vision of what it 's right .
If I could get a single thing to <unk> and to imagine , it would be that they do n't have to be normal .
They can be extraordinary .
Because , you do n't , the differences we have -- they 're a gift ! They are a gift . Every one of us have a gift in their inside and , I was n't , the search of the least is the last power of the potential .
And the opportunity to say , the progress and climate change in the moment that we try to be like the others .
Please do n't tell me that I 'm a normal .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I found a little thing that should have been based on , in the country 's country .
He was taken up to me , a professor of communication , which I 'll give you a little kind of communication to students .
I was proud of it . It 's true of these students with their big minds , their large books and their big and meaning words .
But at the growth of those conversations , I felt what does n't have sense when he brought up by the hole from the tent and saw the door from a new world .
I looked like , I felt when I had these conversations with the students , I gave me the ideas that they had , and I wanted to tell you that others would have this wonderful world .
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication .
We need a big communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of change the world .
Our scientists and engineers are that they 're going to have our biggest challenges , from energy to environment and health care , and if we do n't know , we do n't know about this , the work is not done , and I think it 's our responsibility as not scientists .
But these big conversations ca n't happen if our scientists and engineers do n't get us to see their real world .
So scientists and engineers , <unk> with <unk> .
I want to share some proposal about how you can do to do it for sure that we can see that your science is happy and that its engineering is .
There 's another question to <unk> : and then ?
<unk> why science is relevant for us .
You do n't tell you just just like the <unk> , but we found the <unk> , which are the structure of <unk> of our bones because it 's important to understand to understand and try .
And when you 're looking at your science , they care with the magic .
Poor is a signal for our understanding of their ideas .
You know , you can say , `` space , '' but why do n't say `` space and time , '' which is much more accessible to us ?
<unk> is not the same thing to make them .
At the opposite , as he said , it 's all so simple as possible , but not simple .
They can survive their science without the ideas .
Something to think about it is to use examples , stories , and they are ways to go on , they are ways to go with their content .
And when you get their work , forget about the signs of `` <unk> . ''
You have asked why you call `` <unk> '' ? What do you do it ?
One <unk> like this is not really boring , but it 's going to be interested in the area of the language of our brain , and we would take us .
In change , this <unk> of example of <unk> <unk> is a lot more effective . It shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that really inspired the one of the <unk> of the <unk> .
The trick here is to use a simple phrase , you know , that the public can understand if you get a little , and then then , they 'll be able to get graphs that will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And I think these are just some key that you can help the door and look at the door and look at the country of people who is science and engineering .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you 've heard this equation , all of the media , <unk> with <unk> . Thank you .
A one of my favorite words from all of the <unk> of your Oxford is `` <unk> . ''
Just because it sounds very well .
And `` <unk> , '' means `` <unk> . ''
Although there was a wall in the 19th century that the whole way a lot better when he said , `` A <unk> '' is that that as a <unk> , is that it 's the one , and that , when you get it , and that , when you get it , and that , when you do , you get it by the <unk> use of a
I do n't have a idea of what it means `` <unk> . ''
Something to see with the words , I guess .
It 's very important than the words are the basis in politics , and that all the political knows that they have to try to tell you the language .
It was n't until , for example , <unk> that the British Republic for the family to say the best words that they said in the <unk> camera .
And all of this was thanks to the <unk> of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> , who came to the pain .
I went back in London , and he got the <unk> enough , but then I had the <unk> enough of help them , and at the end of the end , and at the end of it had to support support in London .
And only about years later , we had the first use of the sentence from the phrase , `` This <unk> as <unk> . ''
People think it 's true .
It 's not . It 's by a lack of freedom .
But for you to show you how the words and political beings , I want to go back to the U.S. , just after the circumstances .
So , they had to address the question of how to call George Washington , their leader .
They did n't know .
How do you see the leader of a toy country ?
Now , this is in Congress in Congress for a long time .
They had all sorts of advice that could have <unk> .
Some of the <unk> of Washington . ''
It 's not very disappointed .
Some of them would just call it `` Wow . ''
They were able to change quality .
And we do n't even with it was <unk> , they had the idea that you could have to have the idea that you could be chosen by a sense .
And I could have to go .
All of the world , you 've invented it up , because this debate would get up for three weeks .
And the day of a poor , and I always write , `` I still do this issue . ''
The thing that came up and the <unk> was that the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> did n't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
You do n't go to call him to call him to him , or to their own ideas .
So , they were going to give the biggest title , more expensive , and more libraries that you 've got .
And that title was `` president . ''
Good . It 's not invented the title . There was just before , but just said , `` somebody who would give you a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a jury .
And I did n't have a lot of <unk> that the term '' or `` Queen . ''
There was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the government of government , but really it was really a pencil .
And so that 's why the facts are told .
They said , `` It 's ridiculous , we ca n't be clear . ''
`` This guy has to put it out and share with <unk> <unk> . ''
`` And who would you take it in serious with a beautiful title , so much like the American president ? ''
And finally , after three weeks of debate , the birds do n't know .
We can learn three things about everything .
First of all , and this is my favorite , until I 've been able to figure out , the birds never have <unk> the title of president .
Mr. Barack Obama has lucky to stay there , waiting to the family between action .
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that when a government says that one measure is a sudden -- it 's possible to be able to be able to be able to go back to <unk> .
But the third thing we can learn , and this is the most important thing , and with this thing I want to leave it , is that the title of the American president of the United States does n't sound in all as well today , right ?
And so if you have more of our nuclear head , the biggest economy of the world and a mass of the vehicles and a <unk> and so forth .
The reality and the story have taken to the title of <unk> .
So at the end of the end to the end .
They get their title word .
And also the other concern of the links , the appearance of them -- good , it was a <unk> for then .
But , you know how many nations have now president ?
And it 's all because they want to be like the guy who has the nuclear head , etc. .
So , at the end of the <unk> , and the <unk> of a lost , because there 's no one is going to feel that when you tell you that now are the president of the U.S. .
And I think that 's the great lesson that we can learn , and I 'd like to go back .
The political try to choose and use the words to give you and control the reality , but actually , the reality is a lot of the words that we could change reality .
Thank you very much .
I 'm 45 to feet under the land in a <unk> mine of Ghana .
The air is between heat and dust and it 's hard to breathe .
I feel the <unk> of <unk> bodies , but I ca n't see a lot more .
Let 's hear voices that talk , but about all of it , that <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and they were trained to <unk> tools .
As the other , I 'm going to have a <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the head with this <unk> <unk> , and I can just can be able to tell the <unk> <unk> that we know the walls of the hole of a meter who were hundreds of feet on the land .
It 's <unk> my hand , and suddenly I remember a journalist that I met days before , who lost the control , and he gave me a feet on that right .
As I talk to you today , these men are in the depths of that hole to give their lives without free , or often , dying .
I came from that hole and I went to home , but they may never do it , because they 're able to do it , because they 're looking at the slavery .
In the last 28 years , I 've got the entire cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents , and in 2009 , I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the Grand Bank .
Now , all the amazing people I met there , I met one of <unk> the <unk> <unk> , one of you that 's going to get to the modern slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and actually , I started able to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world , but it 's not going to form .
When I went back to talk about me , I thought , I thought , I was able to be able to get it out of it out of it , and I thought , if I do n't know , how much people do n't know it ?
And he made me an stomach , and weeks later , he went to Los Angeles to know the director of <unk> the <unk> , '' and my help .
So I started my journey of modern slavery .
So , there were a few of these places .
Some , even , I was a second home .
But this time , I 'm going to go back to them .
There 's a second calculation says that there are more than 27 billion people in the world .
It 's the <unk> of the number of Africans 's number in the whole thing about <unk> .
So 150 years ago , the cost of a professor , was about about three times a half times a half of the United States .
The equivalent of about a billion than a lot of 50
Now , today , today , it 's going to go to families , for generations for <unk> <unk> .
Man , the slavery represents over more than more than a half billion dollars a year in all the world .
Many have been prepared with a lot of good education and better work to discover that they 're supposed to work without us , under threat , and they ca n't go .
Now , we 've been able to think of the benefits of cooperation : the services are produced by nature are value , but who they produce it .
The slavery exists in almost all the world , and yet , it 's connected to all the world .
In India , in India , in India , I met the editor of you .
This very strange show , and it was like to go back to the old Egypt , or the <unk> .
<unk> in a temperature of <unk> , men , women , children , in fact , in fact , in fact , families , in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in their head , until 18 to the time , and they take 18 to the time , and they take 18 to the time .
I 'll be able to be able to put it up , and it 's doing it work in silence , doing this task and again for 16 hours a day .
There was no longer to eat , not to go , and the amazing <unk> made it was pretty excited .
It was the heat , and the dust that my camera became too hot to love and left to work .
Every 20 minutes I had to go to the car to go to the team and do that to work with <unk> , and then sitting there , I thought , I thought , my camera is a much better treatment that these people .
On the afternoon I wanted to say , but the <unk> that I was going to love me and said , `` Hey , do n't do it . '' I do n't do it . ''
And I thought , very clearly that show you very dangerous in places like this , not only for me , but for them .
I could n't give you any serious help .
I could n't give you money , nothing .
I was n't aware of that country .
I could put them in a worst situation of the which they were .
I had to trust the <unk> <unk> , and we work inside the system by the system for their neck and put it on .
In order to me , I started to get home to feel my heart .
In the Himalayas , I found young children for per miles per miles per capita , until they were all below .
Those big thing were more than the kids who were the kids who were the kids and the children who are going to go back to their head on their head .
It 's hard to see something so much .
How can we influence it in something as well , but so ?
Some , you do n't even know that they are , and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life .
You do n't have anything with it .
When these were <unk> their freedom , the <unk> <unk> .
When you hear the word of slavery often think of sexual , and because of this world 's ability to be able to be hard to me to work with security in this particular business .
In Stanford , I 'll tell me women who had been seen sex .
I 'm going to get up by some <unk> <unk> , which was going to get this secret dancer , of the <unk> , of the <unk> light .
It was not exactly a creature .
It was more well a restaurant .
<unk> , as you know in the way , they are local for the '60s .
They have a little , <unk> , in the <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children , some of so seven , some of so seven , they 're going to get the customers and to get to buy more food and peace .
Every single hand is dark , and the secret , is by a number on the wall , and it 's a <unk> , and it 's a <unk> .
People often have sexual abuse to hands from their customers .
In foot , I remember , I remember a really sense of fear <unk> , and in that moment , I could barely imagine what it 's going to be going to be going to be going to be done in that much .
I just had a way : I 'll tell you that .
There was no doors .
There were no lot of big enough as well .
Those people do n't have <unk> , and you 've got a topic so hard , it 's important to point that slavery , even the sex , even the sex , is going to our around .
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture , in high and the list and the list can continue .
I was recently , the New York Times , which between 100 children and 300 children are killed every year like sex .
It 's why we do , but we do n't see it .
They are another activity that often do with the <unk> hand .
And I 've been able to have a whole families in which there were two families in the disease .
This is a third of family .
The hands of black <unk> are from the father , the <unk> <unk> , of their children .
<unk> <unk> in these big paradigms , and you can reduce the disease in the liquid until it , but it 's the negative thing .
My uncle told me their stories .
`` We do n't have freedom . ''
`` We still hope , but we can be able to come out from this house , and go to another place where we actually do our work . ''
It 's estimated that there 's more than the most American children in the lake , the most artificial mountains of the world .
When you have , I went to a look like .
I saw what it seemed to be a family family in a boat , two brothers , some more young children , does n't ?
They were all .
The children are aware of their families , they 're going to get to work with <unk> <unk> in the lake in the lake , even even to know .
This child has eight years ago .
When our boat came up , I was eliminated , subject that his little battery was <unk> .
He was coming up by the fear of you go to water .
The branches of the trees in the mountains , they often use networks and children , <unk> , and with fear , you get to the water for the branches .
Many .
And since yesterday , I always have been trying to work in the lake .
And I love her love , it 's not going to come up and , as a whole life has been trying to come up with me , because it 's about the most young people under their own .
I met these young men in the morning , when they brought the last networks , but they had been working from the one one from the one one .
And in the cold night , and it 's like .
And there 's a point that these networks are more from 400 kilos when they 're full of fish .
I want to introduce you to Lagos .
BL was taken up in a village village .
I met in a bed in the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
It turns out as possible .
Who are going to be thanks to be because someone decided to make the difference in your life ?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> . ''
We asked it to the <unk> of land to the forest .
At the end of the road , we 'll be able to go back from the car , and he asked the driver that was rapidly .
And then there would be a symbol that would be able to say and said , `` This is the road , this is the road .
As we started back to go back , we take the <unk> that <unk> the road , and then after walking over a hour we found that the road was <unk> by the recent team , so I put the team of pictures about my head as you 're going to get it in these water .
After two hours of fish , the <unk> road ended up in one of course , and we had a mass of holes who could be able to be in a heart field , and they were all full of animals .
A lot of women had children on their back and , while they wanted the cold , they 'll go into the water .
It 's going to use it in the political process .
These would are sitting in a cold in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the cold , they were sitting in their own lunch .
I remember their eyes tired , <unk> , because of a lot of had been under land for hours hours .
They have to 90 meters and these people and these people would have a little <unk> <unk> , and these people would be able to put back to another area in which we 'll be able to put it back to another area .
In the first view , the website seems to be full , strong men and <unk> , but if we look at more about it , we see we see to work at other dangerous and also children .
They 're all victims of <unk> , disease and violence .
In fact , it 's very likely to be able to go like this one of the <unk> , and of it , in order to put it in a few years .
This is <unk> . When he died his father his uncle gave him to work with him .
When they die their uncle , <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the uncle , which is the force to be a button in the mines .
When I met , I had worked in the 14 14 years , and the spinal cord that you see here is a product of a accident in the mine , so well that the doctors said that I had to be born .
And so that , you 've got to be overweight and , not as that , it 's going to work night and day in that mine .
And so , he 's going to be able to be able to be able to come up , and they brought up with aid of local activists like <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and it 's this kind of poverty , which was this kind of respect .
I want to get light from slavery .
They know that their images would be known by you in all the world .
I wanted to tell you that you 'll give you from them , and we 're going to make all the possible to help change their lives .
I think if we can see you about other other as human beings , then it 's very hard to be able to be able to be able to be able to ignore the slavery .
These images are not from people . They are from people , people and like me , and as I was , and as I do , they do the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There 's not a day that 's going to happen that I do n't think about these so beautiful people , especially , I 've had the great honor to know .
I hope that these images would have a force in who you see , in people as you see , and I hope that that will get a fire , and I hope that that 's a fire , and that 's not that light in slavery because , without that light , the course of slavery can continue to live in the shadows .
Thank you very much .
I do math mathematics , and there 's a little problem for who , we 're like the <unk> of agriculture .
No one knows what we change .
So today today , I 'm going to explain you what I do .
The dance is one of the most human problems .
We 'll get it out of the <unk> , and the dancers of <unk> that we 'll see over .
But the <unk> <unk> , a extraordinary degree , a high level , and probably a single level that you can have a genetic component .
Now unfortunately , the mental disorders like the wrong of course is going to make this extraordinary ability , like what it does with my friend <unk> <unk> that , in his time , it was a <unk> .
In the last years , it has been done a lot in treatment .
But yet , there 's <unk> millions of people in the world that they 're sick and they have to deal with a cup , you see it and other symptoms of this disease , so we need tools tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
We need to measure the progress of real way , and in course , the only way we know whether if we really have a cure to be when we have a objective , and <unk> .
But it 's <unk> that for gravity and other disorders of the movement , not there and the movement of the movement , but that 's why they do n't use the political analysis , and the best we have to have it .
You have to go to a clinic to do it . It 's very , very expensive , and that means that , from the clinical trials , you never do . You 've never done .
And what if you could do it in home ?
That 's a journey of <unk> to the clinic , what if you could make the patients , they could make the test .
They do n't have personal .
On the way , it 's a billion dollars in the political clinic .
So , what I want to tell you as a way to try to try , you see , in a sense at least , we 're all like , like my friend <unk> <unk> .
This is a video of the <unk> .
It shows you a healthy while it does sounds like to talk to you . We can imagine as much of a <unk> <unk> because we have to suggest all of those organs , and we have all have the genes . The <unk> , for example .
And as the <unk> , it requires a extraordinary level of democracy .
Let 's think the time you 're going to try to talk about .
From the sound of the sound , we can be able to get the position of the <unk> , but so as well , and so as the <unk> is going to the boat , also affect the cars .
In the bottom of the bottom you can see a example of the top of the <unk> .
We see the same symptoms .
I got a teenager , you can get it out , and it 's going to go .
The speech is going on , and I lived after a while , and this is a example of the symptoms .
How do you look at these diet based on the voice with these political trials ? Well , both are not .
Now , the <unk> game is not low . They use social infrastructure .
It 's not necessary to design a series of hospitals .
They are low . Well , but besides the <unk> of the voice , they do n't get up .
I mean , you can be <unk> .
They do very rapidly , they take about 30 seconds as much .
They 're from cost and we all know what happens .
And when something like a cost as low , it 's going to scale scale .
These are some amazing technologies to address .
We can reduce the <unk> of the patients .
You do n't have to go to the clinic for the <unk> .
With the high range of high , we could n't get data .
And we could make a massive range of cost for clinical trials , and so , in the first time , we 'll be able to make a general scale .
We have the opportunity to start to look at the first of the disease before it 's too late .
So , I 'll give you today the first steps in that sense , we 're facing the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , we want to have a big amount of voices in all the world to make enough data , and start to address these goals .
We have the local lines for a few billion people in the world .
You know , with it , or without sure , it can be going to be going to go back to the price , and let 's go up with a few cents , and I 'm going to suggest that we 've got six percent of the goal in only eight hours .
Thank you . Let 's put them , we put all these samples of , say 10 people , you can see who 's healthy and who do n't ?
What are you going from these samples ?
He said , Yeah . What happens is that during the call you have to say if you have or not the disease . TR : Of course .
<unk> : You see , some people can not get it .
But we 're going to get a very big show of data in different circumstances , and we do it in different circumstances , is important because we 're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in the real imagination .
TR : They have a 86 percent of precision in this moment ?
<unk> : many more than that .
In fact , my student student , I have to <unk> , has done a fantastic work , and now it has shown that it works in the net network , also , which is the project we 'll get the project .
TR : Two and nine , it 's a improvement .
<unk> : Of course .
TR : Thank you very much . Excuse the public , public .
<unk> : Thank you .
Before , of course , I made it <unk> <unk> in the city of New York .
We are creatures <unk> creatures .
We 'll get it in the dark , in 1994 without windows , and by the general , we 'll get the solar light .
We do the most course models still more , the perfect skin still still do the impossible , possible , and we get it on the press all the time but some of us are really artists with talent , but some of us are really artists with talent with a lot of experience and an photograph .
The 11 of course , I saw from my house , as the rest of the world , the <unk> events that happen in Japan .
Every time later , a organization where it was , there 's <unk> <unk> , was in the place working as a part of the answer of answer .
I know , again with hundreds of other volunteers , we know that we could n't get sitting sitting in home , so I decided to put it to the group for three weeks .
He was 13 to <unk> .
It 's a little village of <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> of a almost 50 people , one of the first people were able to be able to the war .
The <unk> level took more than 24 , and more about three miles land .
As you can imagine , the village was deaf .
We 'll be able to protect the <unk> of the wealth and the future .
<unk> schools . And then we put your homes to be <unk> and <unk> .
They have tons of tons , and tons of fish fish , <unk> , <unk> .
We got it and loved .
For a few weeks , so they gave things like the neighbors found things like .
They found pictures of pictures and cameras and cameras .
They made the same .
<unk> , and we took a different places of the people of all around .
It was n't until then I realized that those pictures of a huge part of the personal people that that people had done .
While they were born from the wave , and to save their lives , they had to stop everything everything they had .
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of the village .
It 's also going to go back to reduce the enormous , <unk> <unk> .
This place , it turned to the place of the village where the center of the <unk> and the center of the <unk> .
And there were a honor , and I had the honor that I 'm going to go back to go back to her hand .
This was exciting and wait , I had heard the expression to think more than the shadows , but it was n't going to go back to me , I 'm not going to look at me .
When you look at the pictures , I found some of a hundred years ago , they were still in the past in the lab , I could n't try to think about how to fix that <unk> , and I knew about hundreds of people who could do .
So , it 's that that night came on Facebook , and the next morning with some of them , and the next morning the answer was so strong and positive , I knew we had to try .
So we started with the pictures .
This was the first of all .
I was not too much , but where the water had <unk> the face of the child , I had to put it up with a lot of precision and it .
In another way , that I did n't have the aspect of it , and that would be so tragic as I have the photo .
With the end of time , they came for most pictures , and they need more <unk> , and you need to be able to get back again in Facebook and Thomas and five days later , and five days later , and five days later .
At the one of two weeks ago , I had 150 people <unk> .
In Japan , in 2007 , we took them to <unk> , a half people in <unk> .
One time to build the week to build our uncle in the British libraries that had been built , where people was going to stop their pictures .
The time that 's going on , is a different story , based from course of the <unk> .
I could be a hour . I could a few weeks ago .
I could be a few months .
This <unk> had to draw a lot of hand using the <unk> of the color of color , and that the water did n't exist .
I took a long time .
The water put all of these pictures in water water , in bacteria , in bacteria , with disease , even with oil , all of it in the end of the time I 'm going to be <unk> , by that <unk> .
We could n't know the picture of less than it was going to call it , it 's called it , and he had been <unk> by their road .
We had very lucky with your hand .
We 've got with the <unk> of a concept .
It 's very easy , even more the pictures .
As it said , a <unk> , the leader of my group is like to do a smile .
You ca n't make mistakes .
The woman who gave us these pictures , I was lucky in relationship to the pictures .
I had started <unk> it , but they were able to realize that the most more .
I also had a parent .
Without them , the images of his husband and their own face would n't have been able to rebuild , we could get the images in a single picture of a picture , and it 's a whole picture .
When I put their pictures of their story with us .
A few colleagues from his husband found the pictures in a <unk> station between the very far of where they used to be his house , but their colleagues would get it .
The day of the page , his husband was the <unk> of close to the <unk> .
He was going to go inside the water while the <unk> .
Their children , not so small now , but their two children were in school , in different and different groups .
One of them was born in the water .
He took a week to find all their family and know that they were all about .
The day that I gave his pictures his son was 14 , 14 .
To her , even even this , those pictures were the best gift that I could do , something that he could go back to look at , something I could go back to look at , something I could remember the past that I did n't have been built by the day of course when everything in their life .
After six months in Japan Scotland had been taken up to the <unk> <unk> , they had taken up to go back back to hand , and the most majority they got to go back to hand , the great majority they get to hands from their imagination .
More from 500 volunteers from all the world we 'll have to give you to 90 families , hundreds of photographs of photographs and <unk> .
For this time , we do n't spend more than a half of a billion people and materials , most materials .
We take pictures of all .
One picture of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a relationship .
They are <unk> from our memories and stories , the last thing that we would do , but the first thing I 'm going to look at .
So this was the project , of a little pieces of humanity , to give someone their connection with the past .
When a picture like this is going to give somebody , actually a huge difference in the life of the person who are coming up .
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk> .
Now , some of them , I 'll give you with something more big , you 'll get something , using their talent for something that do n't be models of the perfect skin .
To end , I 'd like to read this email . He sent up the day I came from Japan after six months .
As <unk> , I could n't try to think about people and the stories we use in images .
A picture of particular , a photo with women from different members from the grandmother to the little child to the little child , and he was working around a baby , I was a picture of my family my grandmother , my mother , I was my mother .
In the whole world , in all the few of the basic needs are the same , right ?
Thank you .
And we 've lost us , and curiosity with this picture of a hole that goes through a apple in a exhibition of only a second of a second of a second .
But now , 50 years later , we can go a million times more fast and see the world 's not a million or a billion , but to a billion times for a day .
I 'm going to show you a new kind of photograph : <unk> , a new technique that can create videos in a new technique of light in movement .
And with that , we can create cameras that you can see after the neighborhood , more than the line of vision , or see the outside of the body without using the <unk> , and it 's actually the idea of camera .
If I take a lawyer , and I looked at it and <unk> in a second of a second , or it 's , in several <unk> to create a piece of <unk> .
And that 's <unk> , that library , to travel to the speed of light , and then again , a million times more fast than a common person .
If we take that band and this <unk> , and we 'll see it in this student , how do you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that happens inside this .
What is the aspect of the light in camera ?
Now , all of this , you remember that it happens in less than a <unk> is what it looks like to fly light .
But this video is 10 billion times more expensive for you can see the light in movement .
Coca-Cola does n't know this research . It 's a lot of things on this film , you 'll get this information to show you what 's happening .
Life , our library , it goes in the student with a <unk> , which begins to <unk> , and it begins to <unk> .
A part of the light is going to the table , and we started to see these .
Many of the course you finally get to the <unk> and then it turns up in a few directions .
As you can see , there 's a bubble in the air that goes on .
In that time , the waves came up by the table , and because of the <unk> of the top you can see in the bottom of the student , after a few pieces , that the God will change .
Now , if we take a common , and we do , and we do that the same distance , and we see it in camera , and you see it in camera , and you think we would think we would have to see that film ?
You ? One week ? It 's all a year .
It would be a very sophisticated film from a <unk> and movement .
And what do you do with nature .
You can see the waves that 's <unk> from the table , of the age and the wall .
It 's like to take a stone in a <unk> .
It 's the way that nature looks like a picture , I thought , from a <unk> , but , of course , our eyes can see a little bit .
But if you look at a time , you 'll tell you that , as the light came out of it , as the light came out of the orange , it 's a brilliant thing .
Why ? And why does it ? Because the orange is <unk> and light in their inside , and it goes back to come back after several <unk> .
In the future , when this <unk> is in their mobile phones , you 're going to go to the supermarket , and then if it 's going to go to the supermarket , and then if you 're going to get it .
What we create this camera in MIT ?
As the United States , you know , if we take a picture of low exhibition , it 's a very time .
But we 're going to spend a billion times more fast than the most short exhibition , so they would just get something of light .
Let 's put that sign , that 's going to compassion , millions of times , and we 'll create one and again with a very risky , and we 'll take those things of data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> .
We can take all of those data in <unk> and <unk> .
You can fly .
Other heroes can be invisible .
And if a new power of a future is going to be able to see after the garden ?
The idea is that we could take something of light on the door , <unk> , walking into the room , a part of it 's going to be in the door , and from there .
And where we could take those multiple pieces of light .
It 's not science fiction . So we 've built .
On the left , it 's our <unk> .
In the wall , there 's a <unk> and <unk> light in the door .
And then from the <unk> of our article in the Mediterranean .
And a little bit of the analogy back to the camera , but interestingly , in a lot of different .
And as we have a camera that it works so fast , our <unk> , has a single potential .
It 's very good , and you can look at the world to the speed of light .
So , we know the way to the door , and also to the <unk> objects , but we do n't know what the point is going to happen .
While a bubble can be able to have a picture in God , which you see in the screen , it does n't have no sense of sense .
But we 're going to get a lot of images that , tens of images , and we 're tens of images , and we 're going to be able to connect the multiple of light , and with that , we can see the object ?
You can be able to see it in 3D ?
This is our <unk> .
We have things for explore before we take this in the lab , but in the future , we could create cars that I 'm going to be back to the end of the curve .
Or we could look at the <unk> conditions looking at the whole windows for the open windows .
Or we could build it to be able to be able to see the inside of the body <unk> , and the same for the <unk> .
But , of course , because of the tissue , and the blood this is pretty hard , so that 's actually a asked to the scientists to try to think about the <unk> , as a new amount of consequence to be able to think about the <unk> problems .
So , I 'm like <unk> , it 's a scientist , it became science in art , a art of photographs .
I realized that all of the data of data that we saw each other , but we can see it , but we can see it .
We create a new form of photograph with camera and code of colors .
And let 's look at those waves . Remember , the time between each of those waves is from only about a second .
But here 's also something fun .
If you look at the waves under the <unk> , these are taken out of us .
The waves should move to us .
What happens here ?
It turns out that , as we 're recording almost the speed of light , we have data effects . You would have to see this picture .
The order of order to make the events in the world sometimes is going to go to the camera .
We 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this prediction .
It 's a time . Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone phone .
A mobile phone can make the life , and they give you freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can have a crime with humanity in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can describe a message , and to start a message , and to start a view in Egypt .
With a cell , you can have been able to have a song , <unk> to <unk> and do famous .
Everything is possible with a cell .
I 'm a <unk> <unk> and live in the city city .
Let 's go to that moment , to this city .
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people who are able to look at a change .
This is the worst of 1989 . Imagine if all of these people who would be able to be able to be able to move from a change , they had a cell in the pocket .
People who have a cell here ?
<unk> .
Your mobile phones , <unk> !
<unk> . One players , a <unk> , <unk> !
It 's a lot . There 's all about today have a cell .
But today , I 'm talking about me , of my mobile cell , and how I changed the life .
Let 's talk about this .
These are 35 <unk> lines .
<unk> .
Why is that information there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the advent of 2006 , I took one .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is that every single company company that every company company , each of the Internet of all Europe , has to build a huge range of information of users .
Who 's called who . Who would take a email who .
Who would take a text to who .
And if we use the cell , where we are .
All of this information , in least six months , and until two years ago , in your phone company or their <unk> 's <unk> .
And in all of the Europe of the people , and he said , `` We do n't want this . ''
They said , they did n't want this right .
We want to get it in the digital was the digital , and we do n't want to be that the phone , and the <unk> <unk> of us .
There were young , journalists , they said , `` We do n't want this . ''
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who came to the streets of Congo and said , `` No , no fear . ''
And some even said that this would be the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was the secret police of rural Germany .
And I also asked if this works really .
Can you store this information about us ?
They use the cell ?
So I asked my phone , <unk> <unk> , which was the biggest company company in Germany , which is why I 'm going to tell me all the information that they had about me .
And I asked a time , and I went back to ask , and I was not going to ask , and I do n't have a great answer . It was everything .
But then I said , I want to have this information , because you are <unk> my life .
And so I decided to be able to be able to be able to make this is because I wanted to have this information .
But <unk> <unk> said not , you do n't give you this information .
At the end of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and they gave me the information that I said .
As so , the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> law of the <unk> .
So , I got this <unk> .
And in the CD there was this .
And a half and five billion <unk> lines of information .
At the beginning I saw , and I said , good , it 's a huge system .
But after a time I realized that it 's my life .
There 's six months of my life in this cave .
It was a little bit : what do n't do with that ?
Because you can see where I 'm , where I look at the night , what I 'm doing .
But then I said , I want to get this information .
I want to make it public .
Because I want to show people to tell people what the price of data .
So , in <unk> <unk> , and I 'm going to take a <unk> , we did this .
This is a component of six months of my life .
You can come back and walk back and go back and go back .
You can see each step to see .
And you can see how I 'm going to go back to me , and with what I 'm going to call in the road .
Everything is possible with this information .
That day a little bit of fear .
But it 's not just about me .
It 's all of us .
First , there 's things like , I call my wife and she 's called , we talk a couple of times .
And then I call me some friends , and you call it between them .
And then one is called the other , and the other at the other , and the other one of the other , and we ended up with this big network network .
You can see how their people would be able to be able to know what a hour call about others , what time sleep .
You can see everything .
You can see the efforts , the leaders of the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what it 's doing society .
If you have access to this information , you can control their society .
This is a model for countries as China and Iran .
This is a model to study the way of your society , because you know who speaks to who you talk about who , who did n't talk about who , who did n't have access to who , everything is possible if you have access to this information .
And that 's a information , at least six months in Europe , and to two years .
As I said to the beginning , imagine if all of these people in the U.S. streets , in the bottom of 1989 , had a cell in the pocket .
And the <unk> would have to know who I was born in this test , and if the <unk> would have to be known who were the leaders , this would never have happened .
And the each of the University of Manhattan may never have happened .
And in a result , not the each of the <unk> <unk> .
Because today , it 's because today , and they want to be able to build a lot of information of us as possible inside us and outside the web .
They want to have the possibility to keep our lives , and they want to get it up to always .
But it 's going to live in the digital era is not a contradiction .
But today , you have to fight by the Germans .
You have to fight for it .
When you go home to her friends , which is a value of the 21st century , and it 's not a way .
When you go home , you know , you 're going to get your appearance that only because the companies and human intelligence can create some information , you do n't have to do it .
And if you do n't believe , they ask your phone company , what information information of you .
So in the future , every time you use their mobile phones that they 'll remember you to remember that they have to fight by all in the digital era .
Thank you .
Hi , let 's say ?
It 's not enough .
Hi , let 's say ?
I call it <unk> <unk> , but I 'm not <unk> , but I know the doctor who gave me the world .
I 'm going to get my mom six times in six different different different cells , <unk> the poor of me in the process .
As a result , I 've got a brain , by that <unk> everything .
Look .
It 's going to go .
And then it 's going to .
It 's not education .
It 's not <unk> .
No one <unk> the director of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were afraid , although they 're .
It 's only about accidents , like the time I 've got to be born .
Now , you know , I 'm not a source of inspiration . And I do n't want you to do any of the way .
It 's great for me , because in some time of life , they 've got to be like .
Let 's go back .
<unk> <unk> , they are in the commercial center , they can drive in circles , and what you see ?
And so 16 places for it .
And you think , `` God , I can be at least a little bit ? ''
And so , I say , I 'm saying , I have a 99 problems , and it 's the catalyst to be just one of them .
There 's a <unk> <unk> , I would get the <unk> <unk> .
I 'm <unk> , <unk> , woman and live in New Jersey .
If it does n't feel better , maybe they should do it .
I 'm from <unk> <unk> , in New Jersey .
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same dinosaurs .
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York , could .
A lot of people with a brain , but my parents do n't do , but my parents do n't believe it . ''
The mantra of my father was , `` You can do it .
If I was my three sisters <unk> , I 'll take it .
If my three sisters were going to school school , my parents <unk> to the school , my parents <unk> the school system , and then if you do n't know all the note of all of my mother .
My father taught me to walk in five years ago , he turned my feet in their feet and just walking .
One of course we used was called a dollar in front of me for me .
The <unk> I 'm very strong and ...
Yes . The first day in the garden , I was born as a <unk> , which has been done a lot .
As we grow , only had six school in my city and were all of the family .
Now , there 's 20 , and they 're going to be all of the family , and they 're going to be all of the family , I think nobody would realize that we did n't know .
So this was before from 9/11 , and that the political show you 'll use it as well to use , `` I 'm going to teach them to the researchers . ''
People with the ones that I had had no problems with my faith .
No , it seemed to be a lot of a lot of <unk> during the <unk> .
I told you that I had enough fat to live three months without eat , so I 'll be able to be able to be able to get out of the 1970s , it 's very easy .
It 's going to go back on .
Yes , in course . It 's crazy . My parents could n't pay the physical therapy , so I 'll get me to school school .
I learned to me , or I can be that I can walk up with <unk> .
I 'm in New Jersey , and there we want to be <unk> , so if my friends were used up , so if my friends were used .
And when my friends were going to go to the summer of summer in the National coast , I was n't .
I was going to go in a area in a area of war , because my parents said that if you do n't go back to Iran all of all of the forest , we 'll get it on .
In the summer of summer , often my father was often about <unk> , so I 'm going to take a milk milk , I 'll get it back in the late Sea , I 'm going to go back on the Sea Sea , and I remember that the water gave me the eyes , and I remember that the water would tell me .
But the bone cure was the temple .
I have to say that it 's very boring , but before I 'll do it , it was a <unk> , I could n't go back to foot .
And I can see it in the head .
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do any thing , that no dream was impossible , and my dream was being going to be in the Nations .
I went to college through the positive and I got a fight to the <unk> , University of the state of Spain , because he looked at all the <unk> .
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater .
They all loved me .
I did all the tasks of the less smart , I took the note in my class , and also in their classes .
Every time he made a scene from the <unk> , my teachers <unk> .
But I never got a role .
Finally , in my last year , the <unk> decided to make a work called a very slow , very slow .
It 's a piece of a girl with a brain .
I was a girl with a brain .
So I started to try to give you to four up , `` When I 'll end a paper !
I have a brain .
On the end of the end !
Thank you about God , I 'll end it ! ''
I do n't have the paper . They gave us a lot of Brown .
And I went to <unk> to the top of the page of theater , it 's gone out , as if someone would have to get back to my cat , to ask him why and she said that because she said that because they think that I could n't do .
And I said , `` Oh , if I ca n't do the object of risk , you ca n't be the character . ''
It was a role for which literally was born , and they gave it to a actor without a brain .
I was my university .
When you have a <unk> story of <unk> actors without <unk> messages .
When I looked at home , and my first <unk> <unk> was like a lot of <unk> .
My dream was done .
And I knew that it would be <unk> from `` <unk> friend '' in a <unk> .
In change , there was there as a flower , I do n't look at it , and it was wrong to me , and it was obvious to me that the cup of <unk> , not <unk> <unk> , not white .
Only <unk> people .
But there were exceptions to the rule .
I looked at <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and all of these women had a thing in common : they were working .
So I did <unk> .
In my first , he took up in New York to New Jersey , and I never forget the face of the first poem that took when he came up when he came up in the realize that he was going to be a high speed for the New Jersey with a room .
I worked in <unk> of the United States , and also in China in the Middle East , without sustainable , and not .
Some people say I 'm the first <unk> of the Arab world .
I never like to convince the first place , but I know that you 've never heard that little <unk> , which says that women are not fun , and we find very fun .
In 2003 , my brother of another mother and father , <unk> <unk> , and I did we launched the mayor of the <unk> <unk> in New York City , now in their <unk> .
Our goal was to change the right image of the <unk> in the communication of communication , and then I 'll tell you to give them to give them back to the <unk> of them , and I 'll tell you it it 's not .
I 'll be able to be able to be a lot more easy to fight the challenge of the disability of disability .
My big opportunity came in 2010 .
I went as I was looking at the case of the news of the <unk> program of <unk> .
I got as if it was a dance dance , I 'm going to give me to a study , and I looked at a painting , and I looked at a wheelchair .
I looked at the morning , and I said , `` Oh , you can give me another chair ? ''
She looked at me and said , `` Five , four , three . ''
And we were living .
So , I 'm going to go back to the desk to do n't come from the screen during the institution , and when I looked at the interview , and when I looked at the interview .
At the end , I had my opportunity and the <unk> . He knew that I did n't get to me .
But it 's not only the <unk> <unk> came to me , but I was born as well , it was like to take a whole time , and let me get my chair .
Something fun that I learned in a lot of <unk> , it was that people in the Internet are building .
It says that children are blind , but I would never get it from me , but I never got a little bit of me .
Suddenly , my disability in the Internet became object .
I saw it up in line , like , `` Why do you do ? ''
`` It 's <unk> ? ''
And my favorite , `` Now my favorite <unk> .
What does it have ?
We really should come up for her . ''
So , one of you thought , I was even going to get my disability to my friend : <unk> , <unk> .
The disability is so visual as race .
If somebody in the U.K. ca n't do from <unk> , then you can not do from someone in a wheelchair .
They are the <unk> -- Yes , man , man .
The way we are the biggest world of the world , and the more <unk> in the world .
The doctors said , but I 'm here in front of you .
And yet , we have grown with media media , I do n't think it was .
I hope you together , we can create images of the disability in the media and in life life .
Maybe if there were more small images , that 's going to go back in the Internet .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we 're still necessary to all the society to teach our children .
My uncle trip me to have very dramatic places .
I went to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
I was going to act in a movie with <unk> <unk> and working with my hippocampus , the amazing alphabet .
<unk> the world , they 've got a crazy . ''
I went to <unk> in a big state of New Jersey in the <unk> <unk> .
And I was born , `` The children of <unk> , '' one organization to give them to the <unk> children to give them to the <unk> , a bit of what my parents gave me .
It was the only time that my father gave me act in alive , and you do this talk to their memory .
[
I call it <unk> <unk> , and if I can , you can also .
I 'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small village .
I do n't know his name , but I know their story .
He lives in a small village in <unk> .
This people is about <unk> .
And the <unk> is a little people to poverty and the edge of the ball .
Not nothing for him , it 's going to the great city , in this case , <unk> , the capital of Somalia .
When you go there , there 's no opportunities , there 's no work , no work .
He was going to live in a galaxy in the city of <unk> .
After maybe a year <unk> , nothing .
One day , I 'm going to take a man who would give me to lunch , after a child , to a <unk> .
It turns out to a group of people , which gives a choice .
It 's going to be a little of money for a little bit of money , and money to move home , their family .
I 'll show you a young .
Finally .
It was a new life .
It 's a goal of life .
A beautiful day in <unk> , under a blue sky , it 's a bomb car .
That kid from the small people with a big village with the great city , and that group of people were in the <unk> , a organization connected to the <unk> , a terrorist organization with the <unk> .
So , how do the story of a little village trying to get their dreams in the city in the city in the city in the city .
He was waiting .
I was waiting for a opportunity , I wanted to start their future , waiting for a perspective of future , and this was the first thing he got .
This was the first thing that I come from what we call `` The period of wait . ''
And their story is going to be available in the world around the world .
And it 's the story of the premise , young people who were <unk> by <unk> , <unk> in London in London , who are looking at something else from the word period . ''
To young people , the promise of the city , the great dream of the city is the opportunity , of well-being , but the young young people do n't participate in the prosperity of their cities .
It 's often the village that 's actually in the more high production rate .
For 2030 , three of every five people who live in cities are under 18 years .
If you do n't take the young people in the growth of our cities , if we do n't make us a opportunities , the story of the least period of wait , '' the door of access to the terrorism , to the violence , being the story of the cities .
And in my American city , <unk> , 70 percent of the young young people .
70 percent do n't work , not to school .
They do n't do anything .
I went to <unk> last month , and I went to visit the <unk> <unk> , the hospital where I was born .
I remember to that hospital <unk> <unk> thinking : And if you 've never gone ?
And if I have seen you to be in the same period of wait ?
Do you have a terrorist ?
I 'm not really sure about the answer .
The reason I was in the reason that I was in <unk> that month , it was actually going to go back to a few leaders in a <unk> .
They 're going to go back to about 90 leaders .
We were born , and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges that create the city .
One of the young people in the room was <unk> .
He was at the University of <unk> , he wrote .
There were no work , no opportunities .
I remember when he told me , that because I was a student student , again , especially , it was the perfect white , and other organizations and other organizations , to be bored .
They were looking like it .
But this story takes a different way .
In <unk> , the biggest reactor to come from the point of the point to the B are the streets .
<unk> years of civil civil war have been completely the <unk> system , and it can be the most easy way to be .
<unk> saw a chance and I did .
It started a <unk> company .
We built it out of the local students who normally could n't go .
And I got 10 degrees , with the help of his family and friends , and their dream is in some way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Why is it different here ?
What does this different story ?
I think their ability to learn and we 'll try a new opportunity .
It 's the <unk> spirit , and I think that the modern spirit can be the most powerful tool against the word period . ''
<unk> people to be the <unk> of the economic opportunity that are looking for so dangerous .
And you can train people to be entrepreneurs .
I want to talk to tell you about a young man who came to one of my meetings , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
I was going to train some of the young people in the top of the <unk> , and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of the <unk> .
In fact , it 's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more 22 years ago , and until a little bit , until it was a bit of them , until they wanted them , if they wanted them flowers for your wedding , <unk> were from plastic .
If you give you to somebody , `` When it was the last time you 'll get flowers ? ''
To those who lived during civil war , the answer would be , `` No . ''
So , I 've seen a opportunity .
It started a company company and design design .
He took a farm in the outside of <unk> , and started to grow up and <unk> it , who 's going to be able to survive the hard climate change .
And it started the <unk> of flowers for serious , creating them in the homes , and the companies in the city , and now it 's working in the creation of the first park of <unk> .
There 's no public parks in <unk> .
It wants to create a space where the families , young people , you can go together , and , as he says , <unk> the <unk> .
On the way , he does n't take them , and they use a lot water .
So , the first step is to take the young people , and in that room , the <unk> presence had a really deep impact in young people .
They had never thought about a business .
I had to work for a cell , work for the government , but their story , its innovation , actually had a strong impact on them .
They 're going to look at their city as a place .
The ones to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , who could be <unk> in change .
To the end of the day , they had to be solutions for some of the biggest challenges that create the city .
<unk> solutions for the local problems .
So , I 'll take the young people and create a <unk> culture , it 's really a great step , but young young people need capital to do their ideas reality .
They need to be , and they do n't do it , and they do n't make them in the development and put it in their business .
<unk> people with the resources that you need to do , <unk> the support that you need to be able to be able to be able to go from the ability to the creation , and you 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be the urban growth .
To me , the modern spirit is something more than start a business .
It 's to create a social impact .
He 's not just able to get flowers .
I think it 's very hope .
His founder of 2030 , this is how it 's called , when it 's created , transform the way that people see their city .
<unk> , I took young children from the street to help you and to keep them to keep them to keep them .
I gave them the opportunity to go from the <unk> , `` period of wait . ''
These young people are having a huge impact in their cities .
So , my proposal is , you go to the young people in entrepreneurs , <unk> and their innovation innovation , and they 'll have more stories about flowers , and they 'll have more stories about flowers , and they 'll have more stories . ''
Thank you .
I had a few years ago , and I went back with me with my dad in mountains , a <unk> area in the state of New York City .
It was a beautiful day .
The forest <unk> .
The sun made that the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and it does n't be by the road that we 're going to be , almost we had the first human human beings in this land .
He came to our camp .
It was a plan in a <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> , when I found something horrible .
I 've been born from the Taliban , from about four meters with the hearts of National apple <unk> of paper paper , and let 's go old .
And I was born , I was very happy and incredibly trivial .
The <unk> who were too absurd as to get what they had taught me , who thought that he was going to go back to her lunch ?
That question did me , and it 's a little bit .
Who 's going to take our deaths ?
It does n't matter like to go or where you can see the `` our '' , who 's going to take our deaths in Istanbul ?
Who 's going to call our <unk> in Rio or in London or in London ?
Here in New York City , the Department of <unk> , at reason from 11 tons of energy and two tons of products , every day .
I wanted to know as individuals .
I wanted to understand who makes that work .
What does you use the uniform , and you 'll take that process ?
So I started an research project with them .
I looked at the mountains , and I walked up by their own , and I chose to people in years and models in all the city , and I learned a lot of it .
I 've got a lot more .
So I started to work as <unk> .
Now , I did n't just come in the police . I was the day .
And it 's the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It was a amazing privilege and a amazing learning .
They all ask the smell .
It 's there , but it 's not as well as you think , and in the day in the day that is very strong you want to rapidly .
It 's a lot of <unk> .
I met people who had worked in that for a few years and their bodies were <unk> to the weight of getting on their body 's body .
It 's also the danger .
You know , with the <unk> <unk> , the source of waste is one of the 10 <unk> of the country , and I learned the reason .
You 're going to go back and go into the energy all the day , and they spend the day .
They just want to <unk> , so in general the driver is not paying attention .
That 's very bad for the day .
And also the one of it , it 's going to be full of ants that often come up in the truck , and we 're using bad damage .
I also learned about the <unk> .
When you give you from the <unk> and you see a city from the end of the truck , you get you to be able to understand that malaria is like a force of nature .
They 've never come back .
It 's also like a way to breathe or Spain .
It was always to be in movement .
And it 's also the guitar .
It seems to me that the guitar is especially ironic because I think it was because of it , that the loss of waste are the most important hand in the city , for three reasons .
They are the first <unk> of public health .
If you do n't have to be able to be a efficient way , and effective every day , this begins to <unk> from their Ph.D. , and their rules were able to be a very real ways .
So we had to describe for decades and centuries , and they start to <unk> .
The economy needs .
If we ca n't go back from the old , we do n't have space for the new way that the mass of the economy start to change when it 's in power .
I do n't know about capitalism , only the relationship .
And then it 's what I call our average speed of us necessary .
And with it , I mean the speed of the speed that they were able to move in the orange time .
We do n't know it , and we do n't know , we would build them or we take it with us with us our cup of coffee , our heat of the <unk> , our <unk> water .
We use them , we 're all talking about them , because we know that there 's a force of work in the other side of the other side of it .
So today , I want to give you a couple of ways to think about the source of waste that maybe they help reduce the <unk> and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human .
Their work , I think , it 's almost <unk> .
They 're in the street every day , of the way .
They use a uniform in many cities .
You know when <unk> .
And their work allows us to do our .
They 're almost a way of magnitude .
The flow that they get us to make us in the same of us , of our own energy , and that 's always always to be able to go from a way or another .
A day after 11 of September from 2001 , I heard the <unk> of a cup of waste in the street , he took my son , and I went back to my son , and there was a man doing their father from paper .
And I tried to go back to make their work that day in particular , but I started back .
And I looked at , and he said , `` We 're going to be good .
Let 's be good . ''
Shortly after that I started to build the source of waste and I went to see that man .
It 's called <unk> , we work together , and we made it good friends .
I want to believe that <unk> was right .
Let 's be good .
But in our efforts , the way we 've been on in this planet as a species we need to put and have to realize all the costs , even the very real human cost of the work .
The waste of the waste , what we think when we talk about plastic , represent three percent of the nation of the nation .
It 's a remarkable consequence .
So in the flow of their days and their lives , the next thing you see someone who would see someone who would look at someone who 's going to get it from you .
I 'm a moment to tell you .
My work is based on the connection of thinking in our life , including part of the environment , where the architecture is also from the conditions and local pieces .
Today , I had two projects as example of this .
We were able to go back in countries , one in Ethiopia , and the other in Ethiopia and the other thing .
And so we share the fact that the different analysis from different fields , you get in a essential part of the whole end of architecture .
The first example started with a invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the World of Ethiopia , applying it out .
This is the kind of building building us as example , to my team and to me , about what we had to design .
At the beginning , the first thing I thought was , `` I want to go back . ''
After seeing some of these buildings , there are a lot of these buildings , there are a lot in the city we realized that there are three things to say .
In the beginning , these buildings are almost empty because they have very big shops in people that people ca n't be able to buy things .
Second , you need to have a lot of energy because of the skin with this is heat in the inside , so it 's necessary too much .
In one city in the city that this should n't happen because it 's about a climate , which is 20 to 25 degrees during all the year .
And in third place , it does n't have nothing to see with Africa , and with Ethiopia .
It 's a lot of a place as rich in culture and traditions .
In our first starting to Ethiopia , I was really able to be able to the old market that is this structure on the air , and thousands of people , you go and buy things every day to a little bit .
This is also that idea of using the public space to create activity activity .
So I thought , that 's what I really wanted to design , not a commercial center .
But the question was how to build a modern building , of a few stories , put these principles .
The next challenge came to the late website , which is in a <unk> area of the city , where a big part of the buildings that now see in the image , not there .
And there is between two streets , they 're not able to communicate in a $ hundreds of meters .
So , the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , they brought all the <unk> of the building .
And this is built up with a place , which creates a space in the building , in the building that 's <unk> , by their own way , and the rain .
And around this space , we 've got the idea of the market with small business , which changes in every floor because of space .
So I also thought , how close the building ?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local conditions .
And I had to think about a place as a <unk> , because it 's a <unk> , and also the <unk> of the air , and also from the light , but also from the light .
And then we put it in these beautiful , we would put it in these beautiful .
They have the properties of the Himalayas , and this helped me to build the apartment .
We 're building that with these little pieces of these little pieces that are the windows who are the windows that they 're going to go on the air and the light of a way to the inside of the building .
This is <unk> with these little lines of colors that use the light in the building to get the building by night .
With these ideas , it does n't be easy to convince you , because they thought , `` That 's not a commercial center . It was not what we do . ''
But in the end of all we realized that this idea of the market was going to be a lot more likely than the international center because of the end of it had more local to sell .
And also the idea of the apartment was more economic , not only because the material in comparison with the glass , but also because it was not necessary to have air conditioning .
So we spend certain of the budget that we use for the project .
The first thing was thinking about how to make the power of energy for the building in a city in the world that electricity is almost every day .
So , we got a big advantage on the ceiling .
And then in those cells we think about the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting , and they would have to get this <unk> .
And these <unk> in the ceiling , which is going to get water for the <unk> .
They wait for principles in the next year , we 're going to go through the U.S. floor .
Now , the second example is a teacher , and services in the city of 2005 .
And to make a project so big , the biggest that I was designed , I needed not just understood to the city of Seattle , but also to their environment , their tradition and culture .
For that analysis , I put special attention in the <unk> , a structure of 1,000 years ago , which was surrounded by a wall with a <unk> of access to the solar lines .
When I went to the place , the first part of design of design we did was built the streets together , creating 12 and features that there are in Africa and other cities of Europe with these biomaterials .
And so that , we know some of that , we take some points in relationship with the idea of the Himalayas , with the dark lines , and this is the <unk> model .
And the last thing was thinking about the cell , the small cell cell , like the apartment , as a essential part of the plan .
I thought , what would be the best <unk> for a apartment in climate climate ?
And it 's a lot of , because it creates a hot difference between both sides of the house , and therefore a natural fiber .
So , I 'm going to be able to be able to be able to tell you that most of the windows are completely involved in that direction .
And this is the result that 's almost like a combination of the European space and the city .
It 's got these building blocks , and then in the lower plant , we have all the connections for the faith .
And they also say to the local rules that create a more density in the levels , and a density in the low plant .
And also this idea of the doors .
The ceiling , which is my favorite space of the project is almost like to be able to the community space .
It 's where all of the neighbors , you can go up , and to do activities , and do activities , and to make it activities as a five miles by the morning , or they jump from a building .
These two examples , they have a common approach in the design process .
And also , they are in countries , where you can see cities literally growing .
In these cities , the impact of architecture in the life of people are available to communities and economies at the same rate of the sun .
On this reason , I see even more important to look at the architecture for simple solutions , but we 'll see the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have to be like to connect nature with people .
Thank you very much .
When I was eight years ago , a new girl looked at our class . It was so remarkable , as you see all the new girls .
I had big amounts of hair , and a little <unk> <unk> and a little <unk> <unk> . It was very good for <unk> , very good for <unk> .
He ended up that year , and I was full of it , until I 'm going to get it out of it , until I 'm going to get it up with me .
One day I was a time after the way after the school of school . It was a little afternoon , and I looked at the bathroom of girls .
When the coast was <unk> , I was born in the room room , he took from the table from my <unk> book .
And then , I did .
<unk> the <unk> of my <unk> , just a little bit , just some .
All of the way , and I 'm going to give you the book to the stomach , but to see , some of my others had very good notes .
So , in a engineer , <unk> the notes from all the world , without no imagination .
I put it to all of <unk> , and I 'm going to be a line of <unk> , just to be there , I could only be there .
I still feel what I did .
I do n't understand how to get the idea .
I do n't understand why I felt well .
I felt important .
I do n't understand why I never come up .
It 's that everything was a obvious thing .
I never found .
But about all , I 'm going to tell me the reason why I was going to tell me that this kid , so little , it was so good for <unk> .
I 'm going to get it up .
They are so <unk> and <unk> .
We know that babies suffer out of it .
You also also have the test . They were very serious .
We know that it 's the number of the number of <unk> , in the U.S. .
And yet , I 've never seen a study that you can be able to take you , or the oxygen or the sadness .
So , you have to go to the fiction , because they 're all about the lab in the lab , which is the lab in all their own ways .
In fact , I do n't know if it 's a pencil to say that if I did n't know , it would have no literature .
Well , I would n't have the <unk> , no , `` Wow . ''
I would n't have the king , or `` The thousand and one night . ''
We would n't have .
I 'll be able to get the <unk> of school school , because we would be losing the <unk> and the <unk> , '' I would n't have `` Stay '' '' '' We do n't have `` <unk> '' '' '' and the <unk> . ''
We do n't know , there 's no longer . Yes , it 's going to tell you that you have the answers for everything , and , in the way , that 's almost that they have all .
This year , you 've got a 100 years of his work , `` In order to come up , '' the most <unk> study of the sex , and also from the details , the God , the God , and also , what we could have .
We think about a child trying to make the dream .
We think about a <unk> <unk> in you .
We forget about what 's that image .
We forget about what it is .
It 's going to say , it 's about books who grew up was so much like <unk> <unk> .
I do n't know how it 's the <unk> <unk> , but we think it 's <unk> .
Let 's see why you 're going as well together , the novel and the tissues , and the tissues , and it 's like it .
It will be very obvious as that the <unk> , you get back to the person , to his wish , they are a major world ?
No . I think that we 've got very close from the bone , when we think about what happens when we understand it .
When we really understand it , we 're seeing us a story .
One story about the life of other people , and those stories do n't feel terrible because they 're designed for that , to make us feel wrong .
You know , in the time , you know , and audience , we know exactly what you 're going to put it , to minimize the knife , not ?
They do n't get it to all of 45 minutes , and that 's something I understood .
All of what she does to give you if you can give you to the other , maybe right now . ''
And it starts to say , I know , I know the story , and since then , he tells you that every single <unk> is that each other <unk> that <unk> it in their uncle , he would take it to her collection of instruments in their private camera .
You have to tell you that <unk> , and they were eliminated .
Now , you know , the <unk> Desert would have to leave the country , if they wanted to go to him .
But you do n't have to be like to recognize that it 's a hard work . Right ?
They are <unk> .
It 's a bad dimension . You have to go .
And how do you do it ?
Now , the <unk> is <unk> .
They use the details .
Now , I 'm going to be like the big amounts of hair and the nice and small <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> .
It 's why we know it is so much successful . You know , it 's a lot of the <unk> language with the <unk> .
When you 're going to be in her <unk> , suddenly you 'll hear behind the doors , and the <unk> to the advent of their uncle , then we 'll tell those behavior .
He says , `` Look , I know that you think about this is , but it 's not different to the performance of a large text or looking to look at a dog . ''
He says , `` It 's amazing scientific value . ''
So you 're trying to show you that you can see <unk> , and they do it seem to <unk> , but they do it seem to <unk> it , but , in the bottom , they are responsible to knowledge , that 's responsible to the truth , a true truth .
The pain , the amygdala , the loss : these were the go to the wisdom of it .
He says , `` One woman who we need to have , that makes us to get , it 's going to have a range of feelings , a whole range of feelings a lot of a lot of a lot of us can be interested . ''
We 're saying that we 're going to look at women women ?
No . I think it 's trying to say that we 're trying to say that we 're going to tell us .
And there is some things that we do with this particular way ?
There 's some other things we 'll take us our own , our crazy , and our rights ?
Do you have a lot of things that tells us to look at the end of so fun ?
Richard wrote about this else .
One day , Dr. was seen by a young young young , which is going up with the idea that his woman would be <unk> .
And Dr. says that there was something strange in that man , which is not <unk> in what he did his wife .
Well , she was true ; all the world I knew .
The poor creature was under a cause .
But he looked at things that did her wife , but I do n't realize , behavior behaviors .
You know , it 's a lot ?
Dr. says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife .
They are very good in this .
They feel very well how we 're going to look at , but it 's not going to look at them .
Now , in fact , the more likely , we are , we are , we are , we are , we have to put it in the <unk> .
And for this reason , I think , we 're going to take you to make a violent perspective or conflict .
And that 's why we take us to be able to be able to take a <unk> ways .
Now I 'm thinking about me in me , I know , but I 'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news .
One woman 's <unk> woman was allowed to have created a realize in Facebook from the which they put messages messages , but I do n't know , for a year .
For a year , all a year .
She was trying to go back to the new girlfriend of his favorite Foundation , I have to tell you that when or this , and this , <unk> with fish .
Because , we do n't know .
What huge , even though , creativity , creativity ?
It 's like novel .
As a novel of a <unk> novel .
<unk> is one of my favorite .
She 's a very strange character and brilliant of the American literature .
And it 's the <unk> of `` <unk> in a <unk> , '' and `` The <unk> <unk> <unk> , books who are trying to how we do n't know how we do n't know how we do n't know how to be in the sphere , and one time we 're in the sphere , and one time we 're in the sphere , which tells us what it
Let 's take a <unk> , their famous character .
I took it <unk> , or I want to want you to give you to take you to take you from your being , and the <unk> of what you 've got to have , and it 's under the floor .
It 's a way .
But what do we do ? We ca n't take the route of <unk> <unk> .
I do n't tell you all the world , so sometimes I would like .
It 's a <unk> , because we live in times .
We live in times .
It 's to say , we are the good citizens of social networks , where the coin is not ?
It does n't show us the road ? No .
So we 're going to do what the characters always do when they 're not sure , when they 're at a mystery .
Let 's go to the <unk> of <unk> Street , and you know , it 's all of us .
When the people think of us , you think in the <unk> <unk> in the fact , that 's the nervous idea .
But I 've always invented in the <unk> ] <unk> , the British face of <unk> <unk> that needs to grow up , needs the kinds of respect , but it does it .
Oh , I sounds so familiar .
They need their help , but the <unk> , and <unk> with each other in the every one .
But as they work together , something begins to change , and finally in `` The <unk> of the <unk> , '' once , it 's going to go back to all with their solution , <unk> it , and says , `` We 're not familiar , sir .
We 're proud of you . ''
And he says , there 's no person in <unk> <unk> that I do n't want to get the hand .
It 's a one of the few times that we see in the story of the story , it seems like this very fragile , right ?
It looks like to try to do it as a problem of geometry , without emotion .
You know , in a minute , it 's the opposite side of <unk> .
At the next minute .
Suddenly , it 's going to be able to see that idea of being him .
Can you even be so simple ?
What if it 's really a issue of geometry , just a question of where we allow us to be in relationship with the other ?
Well , maybe we do n't have to get out of the <unk> of the other .
We can <unk> with her .
But I like to be like to take it .
So while we hope that that happens , let 's try to have the fiction to <unk> .
Just the fiction fiction .
And the fiction was used to the <unk> , the <unk> to the table .
And look at what you know , the <unk> <unk> , the painting I took <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
We 're in great company .
Thank you .
We used to solve big problems .
And the 21 of 2007 , they brought up up out of the <unk> <unk> from the University of 11 , and he turned on the Sea Sea .
Man and gentlemen were alone , but their presence in the Pacific surface was the <unk> of a <unk> process .
The program program was the biggest <unk> in the U.S. history in the United States .
To get to the moon , NASA took a billion billion dollars today , or four percent of the federal budget .
He gave it work to a few people and asked the collaboration of 20 companies , and the community and of the government .
You know , including the <unk> .
But before the <unk> program , 24 men came to the moon .
You 've got to go back on their surface , which were born after the death of Cambridge last year , is now the more old old .
So , why were it ?
They did n't get a lot of back , <unk> kilos of old rocks , and something that the 24 <unk> later , a new sense of the science and the advent of our common home .
Why were it ? The answer response is that they were because the president was because the president was wanted to show it to the helicopter , which this nation had better .
But the best words of Kennedy in Cambridge University , you give us a better idea .
John erectus , you ask , why the moon ?
Why do you do it in our goal ?
And you can also ask , why do you get the lower mountain mountain ?
A 35 years ago , why fly about the Atlantic ?
Why play it in Texas ?
Let 's go to the moon .
Let 's go to the moon .
Let 's go to the moon in this decade , and do other things , not because it 's a simple , but because they 're hard .
<unk> <unk> : Now , in the United States , which was not just a <unk> desert on the east in the past War .
In the time , the most strong emotion was the <unk> of the <unk> of technology .
They were because it was a great power to do it .
The road in the moon happened in a context of a long list of the technological list .
The first half of the 20th century , there was the line of <unk> and the plane and the vaccine and the vaccine for cows .
In half of the 19th century , you 'll get the <unk> , and they put the smallpox .
Now , the technology seemed to be able to put it up with <unk> <unk> , called `` <unk> <unk> . ''
For the most part of the story of humanity , we could n't go more fast than a horse , or a boat with <unk> , but in 2007 , the president of the 10 '' 15 miles per hour .
From course , no human has gone to the moon .
No one has a little bit more fast than the president of 10 , and the optimism of the <unk> of the technology , you know to see that we think we imagine that technology would be able to see the technology to be able to see , which we imagine that technology would be able to go to Mars , create a healthy energy .
I remember the University of the eight 17 .
I was five years ago , and my mother told me that I 'm not going to go to the <unk> tube <unk> <unk> .
He knew that this would be the last mission mission , but I was completely sure that I had to see the colonies in Mars .
So , that 's what that 's going to our ability to solve problems with technology , you have become a common place .
We heard the time .
We 've heard for the two days here , in TED .
It seems like if you were a bit like , and they had to take it with toys with toys , things like fiction and social networks , or algorithms , or algorithms , or algorithms that can be able to reach the <unk> .
There 's no bad thing in most of these things .
They 've been able to get our lives .
But it does n't make the big problems of humanity .
What happened ?
There 's a explanation in Silicon Valley , which they 've got to have created companies that have created companies in the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years .
The Silicon markets says that the markets are the symptoms , as well , the incentives that the <unk> of risk of risk .
The Silicon investment says that the risk of risk , which is the creation of ideas , by the <unk> of mental problems or even bad problems .
But I do n't think that this explanation is good enough .
We 're going to be born that it 's wrong in <unk> .
Even when the <unk> of risk were in their point without trying to do for the risk , they were a little bit of the <unk> of which they get back in 10 years .
The <unk> . They have always had problems to invest with value in technologies as energy , they need a huge capital , which need a huge capital , and it 's not going to go in the development of technologies to solve big problems because they do n't have a commercial value .
No , the reasons why we ca n't solve the big problems , are more complicated .
Sometimes , we 're going to make the big problems .
You could go to Mars if we want .
NASA is even designed a plan .
But they go to Mars , a political decision that was popular , and that 's never going to happen .
We do n't go to Mars because all the world think there 's things more important to do in Earth .
Sometimes , we ca n't solve the big problems because the political systems .
Today , less than two percent of the world 's global consumption of energy power of energy systems like the solar , the wind and the <unk> .
The coal and the natural gas are more expensive than energy energy and the oil is more cheap than the <unk> .
We want to be able to be able to be able to play energy , they do n't exist .
Now , the cultures , the entrepreneurs and economists are about what policies and international growth <unk> the development of a alternative energy : especially , a significant change in research and energy development , and some kind of control of control of the coal .
But there 's no hope in the political climate that we 'll see a energy policy of the United States or international landscape that would be able to be able to get that wealth .
Sometimes , the big problems that was not a technology , it 's going to be not .
We know from time from time , they are a result of failure in the food .
But 30 years ago , we 've taught us that the collective are political crisis that affect the distribution of food distribution .
The technology can improve things like the lights , or the systems for the <unk> , and it 's the systems of food , but there 's there , but there 's there .
On the end , the big problems of times a solution because we do n't understand the problem .
The president of the president came to the war to the cancer , but soon soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer , some dangerous kinds of cancer , and only in the past 10 years that would have been found , and they lose them .
The hard problems are hard .
It 's not true that we ca n't solve the problems with technology .
We can , and we have , but these four elements have to be on , the political leaders have to be done , the political leaders and the population should want to solve the solution ; the institutions they have to support the solution .
The mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems , it is with those streets .
But it 's a <unk> model in the future .
We 're not in 500 .
There 's not a <unk> competition like in the West War , there 's not a political as John Kennedy who would make the hard and the dangerous , and there 's not a part of science , like to explore the solar system .
In general , they go to the moon turned to be simple .
I was just three days .
And really , I do n't even have a problem .
We 're in our present , and the solutions of the future will be more hard to get .
God knows that we do n't have the challenges .
Thank you very much .
Well , I 'm going to talk about the confidence , and I 'm going to begin to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at it .
They are so common that you 've got to be in <unk> of our society .
I think it 's three .
And the first is a language : there 's been a huge decline of trust , it 's a very <unk> belief .
The second is a goal : we should have more trust .
And the third thing is a task : we should take trust .
And I think the way , the goal and the task are wrong .
What I 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a practice , a goal and a task , which I think that gives a most clear idea about the topic .
First of us : why people think that democracy has produced ?
And if I think about the foundation of my own evidence , I do n't know the answer .
I 'll be able to think that may have come down in some activities or institutions , and that could have gone up in other .
I do n't have clear .
But I can come to the 1970s , and the fact of you , they are the source of the belief of the belief that trust trust .
When you look at you , in time , you do n't have a lot of evidence of it .
I mean , the people who 's spent 20 years ago , including journalists and political , they 're going to make the same seeds .
And the people who were very much about 20 years ago , they 're going to be pretty happy : judges , nurses .
The rest of the rest we are in the middle , and by the way , the average of the street , the average of the street is almost exactly about half .
But it 's this enough evidence ?
And what the show you are , of course , opinions .
What else can you get ?
What you look at these are the <unk> devices that people know when you do certain questions .
Do you make the political ? It 's the teachers ?
Now , if somebody would tell you , `` <unk> in the <unk> ?
<unk> in the notes ?
<unk> in the U.S. teachers ? ''
You probably know , `` To do what ? ''
And that would be a very risky answer .
And you could say , when you 've got to ask your question , `` Well , thank you in some , but in other . ''
What it 's very rational .
In course , in the actual life , we tend to be able to make the trust .
We do n't figure out that the level of confidence that we 're going to feel by a certain kind of death , and the kind of person is going to be uniform in all of the cases .
I could , for example , I 'll say that I 've been interested in a certain of America that I know to give you the kind of reading , but in no way to drive the school .
After everything , I could know that it was not a good thing .
I could trust my friend else to keep a conversation , but not , to make a secret .
This is .
And if we 've got those evidence in our lives of the way we 're interested on , why do we go back from the way we think about the knowledge when we think about the knowledge in the most economists ?
And I think that those are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence , because they try to get the good trial , the fact of trust in something or in somebody .
Second , what happens with the goal ?
The goal is to have more trust .
Now , I think it 's a good goal .
It 's not that the goal of me .
I 'm going to have more confidence in what it 's <unk> , but not in what it 's not .
In course , I 'm a <unk> of not trust that it 's not .
And I think that those people who would be able to get their molecules with the <unk> calls called Mr. DK , which then I think of them , I think , good , I think , they were too excited .
We make more confidence is not a smart goal in this life .
It 's going to go up , or they were able to intelligence , that 's the right goal .
One time you say , it says , you know , it means that what happens in the first place is not trust , but it 's how it 's .
So what it 's about to do a things about how you 're going to do is the people in certain things .
And I think to be able to make a trial , we 're supposed to focus in three things .
Are you ? It 's honest ? They are responsible ?
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the <unk> , and it 's responsible and honest , then we 'll have a very good reason to trust them in her , because it 's going to be available .
But if , for the opposite , they are not responsible , we could n't trust them .
I have friends and honest , but I did n't take them in them to take a letter to the son , because they 're <unk> .
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things , but I see that it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the change .
And I feel a lot to tell you that I think I do n't have a lot of friends that they do n't have a lot of friends .
If it 's , I still do n't know .
But that 's what we 're looking for , we know before .
Technology is the answer .
It is what we have to get you .
And of course , it 's hard .
In the last few decades , we 've been able to build systems systems for all sorts of institutions for all sorts of institutions , bacteria , including and others , that we do n't do more easy .
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect .
It does n't work as they should .
I remember one time I was talking about with a <unk> , and he said , `` Well , you see , the problem is that we spend more time to do the <unk> , which would be able to do . ''
And we found the same problem in all our public life , and there is that the <unk> system that 's necessary to figure out and the physical trial , actually is doing the opposite .
What they do is , the work of the people who have to do hard tasks , like the <unk> , <unk> that `` You use it . ''
You know , you know , you know examples .
Everything , everything , by the goal .
And I think the goal should be more rapidly , and that things would be different if you 're going to be a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> to the people that we 're happy and if you 're able to determine if we 're able to determine if other people , including it , and if we 'll be able to determine if other people are often
It 's not easy . It 's the trial , the <unk> , which is not going to do it .
In third place , the task .
I 'll be able to make the task to build trust , you put things on the other thing .
And I would be able to do it , and I should build trust .
Well , we can do it with ourselves .
We can create a little bit .
We can do it , if they 're two people , together , trying to improve trust .
But trust , in course , it 's taught , because we get all other people .
You ca n't change what other people have given us .
You have to give you the way to do you .
You have to be important for trust .
And that 's , of course , it 's because you ca n't get it , by the general , all people , all the time .
But you also have to be able to be able to say , <unk> , you 're important to trust .
How do it do it ?
And that 's a day , everywhere , what makes the common people , the leaders , we were very effective .
I 'll give you a simple example .
And the tent where I read my uncle says I can be able to give any free .
I 'm going to go and put the money , or I get the change by the color .
That 's great . I 'm able to be in them because they were very vulnerable to me .
I think there 's a great lesson in that .
If you be vulnerable to the other part of the other , that 's a very good test test , and you have trust what you 're saying .
So , at the end , I think what we 're going to do is not something very hard to deal .
Now , in what people are going to be in relationships , and in that system , you can determine when and how the other person is available .
Thank you .
From the top of the computers , we 've got to be able to reduce the <unk> between us and the digital information , the represents between our material and the world of the screen in the screen that imagination can be <unk> .
This comes up , it 's gone up , every time and more and more and more and more , as well , as well , in one point of one , the glass of a <unk> screen , and the power of the computer has become accessible to all .
But I ask me , and if you do n't do ?
I started imagine how it would be .
First of this tool that 's going to be in the digital space , so when the strong <unk> against the screen called their physical body .
The designers can get their ideas directly in 3D , and the nurses can create a virtual system under the screen .
So , with this tool , the barriers is .
But the two hands will be still from the screen .
How do you get in and interact with the digital information using all the hands of the hands ?
Now , in the <unk> of course , I started with my <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the computer , and it became a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work .
Now , you 've got a <unk> , <unk> with cameras to detect the fingers and the face , right now , you can see the hands of the keyboard , to be in the inside of the 3D space , and they 're going to make it up with the hands .
As the windows , and you 've got a place in the real space , <unk> is so easy as a <unk> book .
You can look at the book , and the words or words , or words with the virtual system that there are below every screen .
People can be able to be able to take their models directly with the hands .
In these examples , we 're done in the digital world .
And if we invest the eggs and we do that the digital information come to us ?
You know , many of us , many of us , and let 's take things on the Internet .
Now that does n't have to know .
What I have here is a virtual <unk> .
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device in the head or unfortunately when the system is the geometry of your body .
If we take this very far idea , I thought , instead of only see it in space , how we can do that it is , we can do , we can be physical , so they do ?
How would be a future ?
In the World University of MIT with my <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , we created this only physical map .
Now , here , I looked like a company in space in space , which means that so much the computer can move the object that you can move the object to any place in this small space .
<unk> , what we did was providing the religion and control the movement by a combination of <unk> , <unk> , and based .
And when we use the object , we can be able to be out of the age of time and space , what you want to say that the human movements can be able to be able to go back and go back and they 're going to go back , and they 're going to go back and they 're going to go back .
You can teach it <unk> , and to distance , and the famous takes from Michael pages , you can play as a reality of the times we wanted .
The students can use as a tool to understand concepts like the movement of planets , physical , and as much of the <unk> or the books of text , this is a real experience and the books of text , this is a very powerful experience .
But what 's more fascinating to change the part of the computer is to imagine how to create the world is going to change our physical activities .
As you see , the digital information is not just to show you something , but I begin to act directly through us as part of the physical world that we get us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We started the talk of today from a barrier , but if we have that barrier , the only system that is is our imagination .
Thank you .
I 'm going to be able to be in <unk> for two years in <unk> , China , in the 1970s . ''
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to <unk> to a school , to support them with all the <unk> .
But my mother says , `` No . ''
My parents wanted to be in engineering , like them .
And then we were able to survive the Revolution , they 've been able to suggest that there was only a <unk> road to happiness , a good work and well .
No matter if the job I would like or not .
But my dream was to be a team of Chinese furniture .
This was me , in my piano piano .
Now , some of course is to begin to <unk> , very young to learn , so I tried to learn the ones , so I tried everything I could go to go to school school .
So I wrote to the director of school , and at the <unk> of a radio program .
But at any adult , you get the idea .
No adult , I took it very serious .
I just my friends , but they were children , without authority , like me .
So , in 15 years ago , I knew that it was too much more to train .
My dream never do .
I was born , that during the rest of my life , one of my life , one of my life of my life , one is the only thing to what you could .
And this was so nervous .
And so I found on another <unk> .
No one of my around I wanted to tell you ?
<unk> the books .
[ <unk> <unk> '' [ [ `` <unk> <unk> '' [ [ `` The <unk> of the story , '' '' [ '' [ '' [ '' [ `` <unk> of the story '' '' '' ''
Those who were in China , of course .
`` The same Earth '' is about the American life .
And it 's not called <unk> .
The Bible is interesting , but too .
That 's a topic for another day .
But the fifth lesson for me was a revelation : `` You 'll tell your father and your mother . ''
`` <unk> , '' '' I said , `` It 's so different , and a lot better . ''
So he became my tool to come from this <unk> , and to see the relationship with my parents .
And I found with a new culture , also a place to my own habit .
<unk> a lot .
For example , at the beginning of this map , I thought , because this is what the students in China learn .
And I had got to be , who China did n't have to be in the center of the world .
A map shows the perspective of people .
And the high school is not something new .
It 's a common practice in the academic world .
There 's the fields of research as a political religion and literature .
And it 's a <unk> , you 'll give them to the <unk> , a little understanding of a topic .
And I thought , if I was reading it up to work , why do n't do it , why do n't do it .
So I started reading books from two .
You can be from people , `` <unk> Franklin . ''
Now , for the course , the solution are political , policies and hard .
To the beach , they are all of us , it 's all of us , fear , fear and social .
If you know another language , it 's also fun fun to read their favorite books in two languages .
[ `` The way of <unk> <unk> '' Thomas <unk> ] [ `` The path of the <unk> , '' <unk> <unk> in the translation , found you can make a lot of her .
For example , it 's through the translation that I realized that `` happiness '' in Chinese because it does n't mean `` happy '' ''
And `` Gore '' in Chinese , literally means `` new mother . ''
The books gave me a magic door to go with people in the past and the present .
Yes , I 'm not going to be going to do , or it never .
I 've got a quick dream , it 's not not anything with what many other people have done .
And I 've got to believe that compassion is not the only purpose of a dream .
The most important purpose is connect with the place that come to the dreams , where it comes to the passion , where it comes to happiness .
As a dream dream can do that for you .
And it 's thanks to the books , that today I 'm here , happy , living , living with the purpose and with it , most of the time .
So , the books always always do .
Thank you .
Thank you .
When I was in my <unk> , I saw my first client .
I was a student , I was a <unk> student in Berkeley .
She was a woman , `` She was a couple of years ago .
So , I came to the first session using it , and a <unk> <unk> , he turned up in the couch of my office and said , he said I wanted to talk about their problems with men .
When I heard this , I felt so .
My dad had a <unk> as a <unk> .
And I 'm going to get me a <unk> I wanted to talk about men .
And he could be like it .
But I did n't know .
With the stories of the <unk> , they made me easy to the laptop , they made it easy to move the head while the solution .
`` People are the new 20 '' , he said , and why I saw it , she was right .
You start to work after it , it 's home later , it has children later , until the death happens later .
Now , for it , as well , and I had a time .
But a little later , my uncle gave me to realize that I talk about their life life .
I loved me .
I said , `` Of course , it 's coming up with these guys under their category , you 're born with a regular head , but it 's not like if it 's going to go back with him . ''
And then my mom said , `` No , but maybe you get up with the next .
And then , the best time to work in the marriage of us is before you get them . ''
This is what psychologists call a moment , `` Dear ! ''
It was when I realized that the Taliban are not the new <unk> .
Yes , people go to head after what it 's done , but this did n't made it , but this did n't did that the <unk> <unk> were a fight in their development .
This made that the <unk> <unk> is the perfect moment and we were moving .
So I realized , that this kind of <unk> , it was a real problem , and I had the real consequences , not only to be , and their life lives , and the future of all of all around all .
There 's 50 billion in the United States today .
This is the 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think that nobody will come to the videos , not to go back before .
Your hand if you 're in their <unk> .
I want to see the result here .
Oh , Yeah ! It 's amazing .
If they work with you , they love to a coach , you get the dream one , I want to see it . It 's good . No , the fact of truth matter .
This is not just my mind , these are the facts .
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will take the 35 years .
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments , '' which you give you a way to your life have been done for when they have 30 and so many .
People about 40 , they do n't go on .
This audience is going to be good , I think .
We know that the first 10 years of a career have a impact on the amount of money who are going on .
We know that more than half of the American Americans are hungry , they live or they are coming up with their own future to 30 years .
We know that the brain gets his second , and the last amount of growth in their <unk> , and it 's <unk> for the videos , which means that if there 's something I want to change themselves , now is the moment to change .
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> that in any other time of life , and we know that the female was going to come back to her back to the name , and the things are getting hard to the 35 .
The <unk> are the moment to publish your body and their choices .
When we think in the development of the child , we all know that the first five years are critical for language and the challenge in the brain .
It 's a moment in which your life life and common has a impact on the person that you 'll get .
But what we do n't know about it is that there 's something called the adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development .
But this is not what you 're going to hear .
The family talk about changes in the line of the time .
The researchers call the <unk> <unk> .
And the researchers would have <unk> names , like <unk> , '' and `` <unk> . ''
It 's true .
And as culture , we 've been considered a view that actually is the decade that would be able to come up .
He was born , he said to make big things , you need a plan and not enough time .
Is n't true ?
What do you think about when you give you to give you to give you the head in the head and they say , `` You have another 10 years to start your life ? ''
Not about anything .
And I put it to that person , the sense of urgency and their uncle and not nothing .
And then every day , they really smart , interesting as you or their children and daughters go to my office and they say something like , `` I know that my sister is not good for me , but this relationship is not afraid . ''
Or they say , `` You all say that while I could start a career before the 30 , everything will be good . ''
But then it begins to sound something like , `` My <unk> are by <unk> , and I still have nothing to show .
And I had better by the day I graduated from college . ''
And then it begins to sound something like , `` My sister for the <unk> were like the game of chairs .
They all come up and <unk> , but then in some time around the 30 , you get the music and they were all starting to go .
I did n't want to be the only to be the only , so sometimes I think I was going to go to me with my husband because he was the chair , because he was 30 . ''
Where are the result here ?
They do n't do that .
Well , that sounds a little point , but they do n't eat , the risks are very high .
When you get a lot of things for the garden , there 's a huge pressure to the one , and so so so so so many to start a career , choose a partner , choose a couple or three children in a period of time much more short .
A lot of these things are not true , and there 's research that start to show you , which is a lot more difficult and interesting to do everything from a time .
The modern crisis crisis is not about to buy heart cars .
It 's about you realize you ca n't have the career you do now .
You know , you ca n't have the son you do now , or you ca n't give a brother to your son .
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves , and to me , sitting in the room , and talk about their <unk> , `` What was doing ? ''
I want to change what you 're doing and thinking .
Here 's a story of how it could be .
It 's a story about a woman called Emma .
In 25 , let 's go to my office because I was , in their own words , having a crisis crisis .
He said , I 'd like to work in art or in entertainment , but they still could n't decide , so I spent the past years working as well .
As it was more cheap , lived with a God who showed you beyond .
And even even to live a very hard <unk> , his life had been still harder .
<unk> in our laptop , but then they were born she said , `` You do n't go to her family , but you can choose their friends . ''
Well , one day later he got his head on his legs , and I read for almost the time .
I was going to buy a new piece of a lot of a bit , and there was past the morning <unk> with their lot , but then he looked at the vacuum space that goes back after the words `` In case , please go to ... ''
I was going to point from the point when I saw , and he said , `` Who 's going to be for me if I have a accident ?
Who 's going to look at me if I 'm going to do it cancer ? ''
In that moment , I was a lot of work , and I do n't say , `` I '' ''
What I needed it was not a <unk> , which is true .
And let me have a best life , and I knew that this was their opportunity .
I had learned a lot of since that I worked with us as a single thing as I was just going to go back as the decade I 'm going to end up while the 1970s .
So , for the next weeks , and months , I said to 12 , I said , `` Oh , I said to add three things that everything did , man or woman .
First of all , I said , I said , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know about that crisis of identity and <unk> capital .
The capital of identity , I mean to do something that makes value value to their person .
It 's something that 's a investment in what they want to be later .
I did n't know the future of Emma , and nobody knows the future of the work , but I know , I know this : capital of identity has mass capital .
So now , it 's the moment for the other side of the other side of the country , from that , from that company who want to test .
I do n't know the exploration exploration , I 'm going to take the exploration that should n't tell you , that , by the way , is not exploration .
It 's <unk> .
I said , I said to him , and they do n't tell them .
Second , I said to Emma that penguins are <unk> .
The other friends are good to give you to the airport , but the ones that they 're going to get back with friends with friends with life , where you know , how do you know , how do you know , how do you know , how do you know , how do you do .
That new piece of capital , that new person with who come almost always come out of it comes out of the outside of his circle .
And the new things come from what you call it up , the <unk> of friends of their friends .
Yes , half of you have a bad job or not work .
But the other half you do n't , and the muscle , are the way of <unk> to this group .
The half of the jobs had never come up , then , I know the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a work .
It 's not to do it . It 's the science of how information is happening .
On the end , not less important , let 's think that you do n't go to his family , but I know their friends .
This was true when I was growing , but as <unk> , Emma <unk> to her family , when you have a partner and make their own family .
I said , `` I said , `` time to choose their family to choose his family had gone .
Maybe you think about the 30 is better , to go to head that 20 or even 25 , and I 'm sure with you .
But they choose to the person with the person that you live now , or you 're going to give you now when you all in Facebook start to walk into the engineer is not progress .
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have , and that 's going to be so wrong in the love as you 're in the work .
They have your family to be a aware of who , and what is what you want to do in place , and what it 's what you want to work in place to only work or killing them .
So , what happened with Emma ?
Well , let 's put that , and she found out of a quarter of a cousin that worked in a cousin that worked in a bird in the other state .
This is the weak link to get a work there .
Now , that 's a single reason to stop the reason to leave the book with the living .
Now , five years later , it 's a special of events in terms .
Now , here , with a man who would find it .
It 's a new career , love his new family , and I got a letter that said , `` Now the public spaces are not good enough . ''
The story of course you can be easy , but that 's what I love to work with it .
It 's very easy to help .
They 're going to be as a planes who are coming from the airport of Los Angeles , they go to some place of the West .
You know , before you know , a <unk> light in their light makes the difference between land or in Monterey .
Now , in the same way , to 25 or 25 , and even at the age , a good thing , a good hand , a good matter , a good effects , a good effects , a good effects .
Here 's my idea that 's going to all of the way you know .
It 's so simple as what I learned to tell you .
And it 's what I 'm now the privilege to tell you as Emma all the days : The <unk> is not the new <unk> , <unk> their videos , they get their videos , they get their videos , they use their family .
You do n't let you change why they did n't know or what they did n't did .
They 're asked their life today .
Thank you .
When I was 27 years ago , he left a very serious work in urbanization for a work that was still more optimistic .
I went to show you mathematics to students from New York City .
And as a professor , and as a professor , and we 've got a particular thing .
I 'll tell you .
When the work would come up , it 's <unk> .
What I called the attention was that the <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my best students .
Some of the ones who had a better performance they had no <unk> .
Now , some of my most smart children do n't go as well .
And that 's going to think .
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in Britain , sure , they are hard , they are a <unk> , <unk> .
But these concepts are not a single thing , and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they were able to learn the lesson .
After a few years later , I got to the conclusion that we need in education is a best understanding of the students and learning from a complex perspective , from a psychological perspective .
In education , the only thing we know how to measure of the best way .
It 's the <unk> , but what if you have success in school and in life on a lot more than the ability to learn about a quick way and easy ?
So I left the classrooms , and I went to college for college .
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of trivial , and in every study my question was , who has success here and why ?
My team of research , and I went to the <unk> of the West <unk> .
We 're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training , and who 's <unk> .
We went to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we try to predict what children would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
We were looking at teachers working working in very hard , <unk> what teachers are still waiting for the end of the school year and from those , who will be the more effective results of learning their students ?
We took them with private companies , ask , what of these transformations are going to keep their family in work ?
And who will make more money ?
In all of those very different experience , we got a feature as a important point of success .
And it 's not the social intelligence .
It 's not the good appearance , health health , and it was not .
It was the poverty .
It is a lot of passion , and it turns out to get a very long goals .
It is to have resistance .
It 's going to go to their future , day after day , not just by the week , not only by the month , but for years and working really hard to do that future .
It is to live life as if it was a laptop , not a career to all speed .
A few years ago , I started trying to study it in school schools in Chicago .
I asked them to thousands of high students who do n't tell my lifestyle , and then I turned around about more than a year to see people who are <unk> .
It turns out that the children with more likely , they were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get back , even when the <unk> in every point that I could measure , things like the family , the results of the physics , even the security results .
So , it 's not only in the West , or in the National <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , it 's also in school , especially for children in risk of <unk> .
To me , the most popular thing about self-esteem is the little thing we know , what does the science about their development .
Every day , parents and teachers told me , `` How do they use it in children ?
What should you do to teach the children , a mass of work ?
How do you make them for the long term ? ''
The most honest answer is : I do n't know . What I know it is that the talent do n't care .
Our data show very clearly that there are a lot of intellectual individuals that just do n't go back with their dog .
In fact , in our data , they 're not going to be it out , or it 's not that it 's not that , or it 's even going to be able to be able to be able to be able to bring it to the individual things .
So now , the best idea I 've heard about to develop the disability in children is something called `` <unk> of growth . ''
This is a whole idea in the University of Stanford , and it 's the belief that the ability to learn not , that can change with the effort .
<unk> . They have shown that when the children read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge , they 're much more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be , because they do n't believe that that 's a permanent condition .
So , the growth of growth is a great idea to develop care .
But we need more .
And there 's where I end my speech , because there 's where we 're .
That 's the work we have in front .
We need to take our best ideas , our most strong , and we need to try .
We need to measure if they have been done , and we have to be willing to be willing to be willing to help us , to start , to start everything again with the lessons .
In other words , we need to be aware about to do that our children are more likely .
Thank you .
<unk> in Chile as the daughter of a <unk> , one of my <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty , the way and the way of the Chinese characters .
From that moment , I 'm going to be <unk> by this amazing language .
But for a <unk> , it seems to be as well as the Grand <unk> .
In the last few years , I 've been wondering if I can put it to it , so that I can be able to understand this sign , so that you want to understand and see the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it .
I started thinking about how a new method and fast to learn Chinese might be useful .
Since I was five years ago , I started able to learn how to draw every single one of the mountains in the right response .
I learned a new characters every day for the next 15 years .
And so we just have five minutes , it 's better than we do in a more fast way .
It 's a Chinese South 20 thousand languages .
You just need to understand the basic nature .
And the first 200 , you can be able to understand the 40 percent of the basic literature , so enough to read signals to read signals , <unk> , understanding the basic idea of the pages .
So now I start with eight to show you how the method works .
Are you ready ?
You get your mouth as you can be possible until it 's a square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person that 's going to give a walk .
<unk> .
If the way of the fire is a person with arms in both sides , as if he was going to go back in a single way , `` <unk> ! I 'm going to say ! '' This symbol actually is , `` <unk> ! '' This symbol actually is , `` <unk> ! ''
This is a tree .
tree tree tree tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door , it seems to a couple of <unk> of a <unk> in the old West .
Now , I 'm looking at these eight characters .
They 're building building building that you think many more characters .
One person .
If you go back to , that 's `` continue . ''
As the old says , two are company , three are a company .
If a person gave their arms , this person is saying `` I was so big . ''
The person in the mouth , the person is born .
It 's a matter , as a <unk> in the book .
A tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have a forest .
Three trees together , we also have the forest .
Let 's take a table under the tree , we have the power .
Let 's take a mouth on the tree , that 's a `` <unk> . ''
Remember the fire ?
Two , it 's very hot .
Three , that 's a lot of us together .
They take the fire under the two trees , that 's <unk> .
To us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Two together , you know .
Three together , those are absurd .
They go to the sun and the hot moon together , that 's the <unk> .
It also means morning , after a day and one day .
The sun comes on the horizon .
One door . Let 's take a table inside the door , it 's the king of the door .
Let 's take a mouth inside the door , to do questions .
<unk> , there 's someone in home ?
This person is coming out of a door , <unk> , <unk> .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they are built .
Three women together , they have care about it .
So we 've already past by nearly 30 characters .
And when you use this method , the first eight experiments we 'll be able to build 32 .
The next group of eight , we build other 32 .
So with every little effort , it will be able to learn a couple of characters , which is the same thing that is the same thing about a Chinese eight years .
So after I know , we started to create free .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have a sea mountain . It 's a volcano .
We know that Japan is the land land .
This is a sun put up with the origin , because Japan is the east of China .
So , a sun came back to the origin , we created Japan .
One person behind Japan , what do we have ?
One person .
The character in the left are two mountains in the top .
In the old China , that meant in Caltech , because the Chinese <unk> to their political investors beyond the mountains .
Now , in the day , Sarah has gone on .
A mouth who says to where it 's a way .
This is a slide to tell you that I have to stop to talk about , and it 's back to the stage . Thank you .
What I 'm going to be dad is the movies that I 'm going to see .
I love to share my favorite films with my children ; when my daughter had four years ago , we saw it the Nobel Prize together .
The movie film his imagination for months .
Your favorite character was <unk> , of course .
He gave you a good excuse to use a brilliant , and they 'll take a magic .
But to see that film , so you get to understand that it 's amazing .
We now live and we put our children in a sort of industrial complex of a child .
But yet , the Nobel Prize was a event in itself .
It 's not started that trend .
And the trend actually took a few years old years ago with , interestingly , another film because of a <unk> , a kid , and a kid <unk> to a girl in the enemy .
You know what I 'm talking about ? Yes .
There 's a big difference between these two films , there 's a couple of big differences between the east of Ghana and all the movies that we see today .
One is that there 's very a little violence in the Himalayas .
The monkeys are pretty successful , like the garden .
But I think , if I think , if the advent of cinema are done today , the gentleman would say , `` Wow , you are the <unk> , you 're going to go up it .
You have to get shoes , and I 'm going to take them to get it into the midst of the <unk> <unk> .
But that 's not what happens .
One other thing of the advent of Coke is that the most <unk> characters , and they even are still women .
I started looking at this when I did see it , when I did to see a quote to my daughter , a few years later , and the situation was different .
In that moment , I also had a son .
It 's just three years .
It was n't surprised to the projection because it was still very small for that .
But it was the second son , and the <unk> level had gone up . And so it 's in the room , and I was born in the room , and I was born , in the room , and I do n't think he was going to go back , but I do n't think he was going to get it , but I do n't think he
I ask me what you can .
Do you get the issues of value , etc. and mechanics ?
Do you do the sense of a army to bring the government ?
It 's going to be able to get this with the advent of invisibility .
How do you give you a movie ?
So let 's look at it , and being a <unk> .
It 's the kind of world in the world I want to be able to happen , right ?
Why are there so much capital capital , force in the films for our children , and so a little bit of the <unk> way ?
There 's a lot of literature about the impact of the films of violence in girls , and they should hear it . It 's very good .
I do n't read so much about how the children are able to do this prediction .
Yes , by experience that Dr. <unk> does n't change the right system that I would have to be able to fly through the world of the adults that it 's like , I think that in the moment of the first hand , I actually realized that I think of the end of the first hand , I actually realized that the fact of the film .
My writing has ended up , I have .
Why do you go back there ?
I do n't know what I should do .
The films is going to go back to you , and they get their reward , and they do n't stop time for other relationships or other things .
It 's almost like if it 's going to be a child , you have to be a <unk> animal , and if you 're a girl , you have to use a suit .
There 's a lot of exceptions , and let 's go to the <unk> of Disney in any of you .
But they send a message to the children , even though , the boys , they are not really your own goal .
They do a remarkable job to teach the girls how to take the girls , and not necessarily teach the kids how to jump from it .
There is no model for them .
We also have some big women who are making new stories for our children , so real and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , but they do n't tell you to be movies from war .
Of course , the most successful topic of all the times it comes up in a sudden , every single one of them on the <unk> of a child or a man , or two men who are friends , or two men who are friends , or two men who are told a child .
And so , as many of you are thinking , this year , finally came up with it .
I show you to all of you . It 's available in shops .
You remember what the critical said when he came up ?
I ca n't believe that it 's made a movie film .
It 's very good . You do n't let it .
Well , almost none of these films on <unk> .
I do n't know if you 've heard about this .
You do n't have the roots , and it 's not , but maybe today to start a movement .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> of mine , and in the time of the '80s , he took a conversation that had had a girl on the movies of the films you saw .
And it 's very simple . There 's just three questions that you have to do : in the movie , there 's more from a <unk> character that has lines ?
So , you have to get the destiny .
These women talk about it in some moment of the movie ?
Their conversations are about something more than the kid that I do like ?
Two women who are and talk about things between themselves .
And I 've seen , and I 've seen , and yet I see it in the film that we know and love .
In fact , this week I went to see a very good movie movie , <unk> .
Right ? It 's <unk> , success , a idea of <unk> , a idea of <unk> , which is a movie film .
No , not about the <unk> test .
And I do n't think that it was , because a lot of the film , I do n't know if you 've seen , a lot of the movie happens in a hole where men and women are done in the crisis of the advice .
We have a lot of men from men who have kind of beautiful conversations and they 've got in this stage , and it 's the great moment for one of the fact for a look at the door and say , and say , it 's going to bed , finger ?
This is Hollywood .
So , we 're going to go in the numbers .
In 2011 , in 2011 , the most popular movies , how many of them believe that they 've been able to happen ?
It 's not wrong .
It 's not the universe that the number of women who have been recently recently for Congress , then it 's good .
But there 's a number more than this that 's going to do this room .
The last year , The New York Times found a study that the government had done .
This is what he said .
In the United States , one of every five women says that it has been able to be able to make any time in their life .
I do n't think it 's the fault .
I do n't think the films for children have something to see with that .
I do n't think that the videos of music , or they 're threatened , but something else 's wrong , but when I hear that statistic , one of the things I think is that there 's a great amount of <unk> .
Who are those guys ? What are they learning ?
What do n't you learn ?
They 're <unk> the story that says that the role of a sound hero is to explain to it with violence and then they get the reward , which is a woman who does n't have friends and do n't talk ?
We 're going to get a story ?
You know , as a parent with the privilege of putting a daughter like those of you who are doing the same , we found this world and this sort of <unk> , and we want to <unk> it .
We have tools like <unk> <unk> , and we hope that that to help me , but I have to ask it , <unk> <unk> is going to say , in the same time , in the same time , we 're able to ask it to <unk> if you get their children for they get their own power ?
I mean , I think the list of course is a way to do something important , and here I mean the parents .
And I think we have to show our children , a new definition of <unk> .
And the definition of it is changing too .
You 'll read about how the new economy is changing the paper that 's going to go back and the <unk> .
Everything is changing .
When I asked my daughter , which was his favorite <unk> character , you know what he said ?
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
What do you have in common these two ?
Maybe it 's not just a brilliant boy .
I think it 's experts .
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than no one , and I love to share their knowledge with other people to reach their potential .
They are leaders .
I like that kind of stories for my daughter , and I like that kind of stories for my son .
I want more stories like that .
I want less stories in which you tell my son : I 'll fight and just and more stories where he saw their work is brought to a team , maybe a team of women to improve women , to help each other people , to help each other people , to help each other people .
Thank you .
In a child , lived in bed , and one of the things that I was looking at it , and one of the things that I was looking at it , and I was looking at the sea , where my parents told me that I 'm sorry .
But you know , it 's hard to find these .
They are in the sand , and it 's hard to see .
Yet , with the time , I was going to go back to them .
I started to see ways and patterns that gave me <unk> .
This became a passion for finding things , in a love , in a love , and the amygdala .
And finally when I started to study <unk> , I realized that I see with my own eyes not enough .
Because , as soon , in Egypt , my little beach in China had grown to one of a almost <unk> miles on the desert .
And I got to get out of sea , they had grown the size of cities .
This is really what I brought to use images .
To try to do a map of the past , I knew that I had to see in another way .
I want to show you a example of how different we see to the use .
This is a <unk> place in the World Cup called <unk> .
And the place , a simple view , it seems to be low , but when we use it , and when we use it , and we can use a little color , a few color , a few color .
What you 're seeing is the real human changes of the landscape , by the materials of building , and the public activities .
I want to share with you how we 've used the average data to find a American city , called <unk> , lost for thousands of years .
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire is about 50 years ago .
The place you get in the <unk> , Egypt , and it 's really important because in the Middle Empire , there was this great number of the old art of the ancient art , architecture and religion .
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was taken up in some place about the least of the two bees that we built in the top of the two bees that we built it in the red circles here , but in some place inside this huge amount of stars .
This area is a huge area , it 's about it 's about <unk> .
Before , the roof of <unk> , and as well as it changed with the time , they went to the top of this , and then the city .
So how to find a city in a <unk> landscape ?
And they were able to be the equivalent to look at a needle in a coin , with the eyes , and using the eyes , and using a technique .
So , we use data from NASA to make a map of the place , with very simple change .
We could actually see why we 're going to be able to do that .
But you can see more interesting , and it 's still more interesting , this is still more interesting , that 's a little bit of interesting , that we think it could be the object of <unk> .
So we do with the scientists , they make them doing jobs , you can see here .
When I 'm saying , it 's like the <unk> of shows in ice , but in place , in terms of climate climate change , we 're looking at the human brain .
five feet down , under a <unk> layer , we found a blue layer of <unk> objects .
This means that in this way of <unk> , five feet down , we have a square layer of a few hundreds of years that came from the Middle Empire , exactly the same period we think it 's <unk> .
We also found around <unk> , <unk> , and you know , what shows that there was a formula block .
This might seem that it 's not a lot , but when we think about the most common of the most common of the Middle Empire , these are the algorithms that are used .
So , we have a <unk> layer of instructions that comes from the Middle Empire in this place .
We also have evidence from a <unk> block that shows that what 's been there , it was a very important city .
We do n't find <unk> here , but we 'll be able to place in a place in a long future to be able to go .
And even more important , we have the resources to train young people in the use of technology , so they can also make big discoveries .
I want to share with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire , I probably was probably written in <unk> billion years .
And the knowledge is the most of all the <unk> .
There 's nothing like that in the land .
So as it seems like , TED was n't born in 1984 <unk> .
Now , the ideas are actually started in 1984 , in a whole city , not for a long time and found from the high .
It 's going to be the search to make it in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I want to put it to the eyes .
Let 's see you outside , in front at the door of <unk> .
I 'd like to get attention to the color of the door , the material that 's done .
Now , we 've got a group of <unk> <unk> .
They 're used in a <unk> career <unk> , and they 're going to go back to her door .
I need to see this really .
They are very strong , you 're going to go up , you 're going to go up .
And they get back in front of his house .
There are <unk> air around all of all , the plane they go back to her side , it 's the <unk> of the desert that they end in the door .
And at it , when it 's , or what there 's at the other side of the door , and look at the quality of light , and look at the quality of light .
They 're born with the hand .
And from his chair , about a low horse .
It 's a horse who speaks .
They can feel their blue , blue , <unk> , you can be able to feel your blue .
You can give you the <unk> , and you 'll see it 's going to go back to point in the mouth .
Let 's give you for a side , and they put her room to be .
So in the room , and they do use of their imagination , you think of it , you look at it .
It 's with a little clothes , it 's working on the middle of the center , I said , `` <unk> me . ''
Now let me go to the kitchen .
The floor has been taken up with a <unk> road , and from the oven come to you , the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> . ''
OK . You get the eyes .
I want to tell you about a little bit that it takes every past in New York City .
It 's called the `` <unk> <unk> . ''
I went to show this event a few years ago as a journalist , waiting to , I guess , that this is like the end of a <unk> <unk> .
There were several men and a few of different and different habits and different habits .
They were hundreds of hundreds of different numbers , look at only once .
You 'll get the names of tens and tens of strange .
<unk> poems .
And I 'll be able to see who I could put up with more rapidly the order of a <unk> .
And I thought , `` This is amazing . ''
These people have to be evidence of nature .
And I started talking about some of the robots .
This , it 's a man called <unk> <unk> who had come from from England , and they have one of the best <unk> .
I said , `` Hey , when you do you realize that they were a magic ? ''
He said , `` I 'm not a little bit .
Actually , I have a average memory .
They all about this competition say that they have memory memory .
`` We 've been trained to do these acts of memory using a certain number of memory using a lot old techniques , which has a half years in Greece , the same techniques that actually used to put their vision , and that the <unk> cows were able to put their clothes , and that the <unk> cows were able to put their eggs . ''
And my reaction was , `` Wow . How do n't have heard about this before ? ''
We were there out of the room in the competition , and they said , who 's a wonderful English English and brilliant , although a little bit of it , he said , `` One , you 're a American team .
You know , they 're going to try to go ahead ? ''
And I said , `` What ? No , why ?
`` Because I 'd like to teach me to paint , and how to bring the order in the order of the order in one of the living in a living in national television .
That 's going to the world that anyone can do . ''
And I said , `` Well , I do n't mean , but maybe you can tell me .
Or , you have to start for something ? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
He ended up over the most part of the next year , not only my memory , but also <unk> , trying to understand how it works , why do n't work and what can be their potential .
I met a lot of really interesting .
This is a man called <unk> .
He 's <unk> , very probably with the worst memory in the world .
Their memory was so bad that I would n't even get a problem of memory ; it 's amazing .
A incredibly tragic test , but it was a window that allows you to see until what our memory will us do .
In the other end of the spectrum I met this man .
This is <unk> <unk> . In him , it 's taken up for the paper role on the film `` Grand Park . ''
We got a afternoon together in the public library in the middle library City City City City , and it was going on .
And when you go back , it 's a amount of reminder about the writing of the writing something more than more than a lot of years in terms , in the <unk> and then then in the desert floor .
And I learned a lot of things .
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having memory memory , etc. , and it was not one thing as well as well as well .
A lot of time , people put in their memory , in order to make the minds .
These techniques have done our modern world , but we also have changed .
We 've been changed , and I would say that we 've changed , also .
As you do n't have to remember to remember , sometimes it seems that we 've forgotten how to do it .
One of the last places in our planet where we still find people on this idea of a memory of a memory of a memory of a little memory , etc. , and basically it is this competition .
In fact , it 's not so hard ; there 's like this .
I was surprised , I wanted to know how to do these people .
A few years ago , a group of researchers from the University of London gave a group of memory , the lab .
They wanted to know , it 's going to have brains in some way , we would be a brains in a way , we would be able to get different or different .
The answer was , not .
You 're a lot of smart than the rest ?
They gave them a battery battery , and the answer was actually , not .
There was not , a really interesting difference between the brains of memory of memory , and the most of the subjects of control with it .
When you put them in a machine , <unk> their brains as <unk> numbers , faces and forms of snow .
In effect of them , or it was trying to use , a part of the brain that needs memory memory .
Why ?
Now , the <unk> rate is like a <unk> career in where every year is someone with a new way to remember more things , more rapidly , and then the rest of the robots have to get the day .
This is my friend Street , three times of memory .
In his desk , in front of him , there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> that he 's going to try to participate in a hour , using a technique that he invented , and it was only it .
He was used a technique that 's going to take the <unk> order of <unk> <unk> .
A half hour . Yes .
And while there 's a great amount of ways to remember things in these things , absolutely all of the actual techniques at the end of the end of the end is going to get a concept that psychologists call `` <unk> <unk> . ''
It 's known with a scientific paradox as the paradox `` <unk> . ''
That 's his name .
And then I ask you , `` remember that there 's a `` <unk> . ''
And when I go back in late , and I ask you `` remember that word I told you a while ? ''
`` remember what it was ? ''
The person who said that his name is a little likely to remember the same word that the person who said that their work is `` <unk> . ''
The same word , different capacity of remember ; that 's amazing .
What happens here ?
Well , the name 's name , actually does n't mean anything for you .
And with all of the other memories that they go for their head .
But the word , `` <unk> . ''
They use the white tissues .
They have in the hands .
I 'll be able to go back to work .
You know , you know , you know some of us .
And when you get that word for the first time , we started <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in some <unk> moment .
One of the most fun techniques to do this number of a half years in the 1970s .
It 's known as the <unk> of memory . ''
The story says this : there was a poet called <unk> that I was going to get up to a place .
He had gone up as entertainment , because before , if I wanted to give a very good party , you do n't get a very good party , you 're not taken to a joke .
He came back to foot , <unk> her poem , and he got it , and so soon it was , and so soon it was , and so soon it was .
They were killing all .
But it 's not only the left to all , but it 's going to look at the bodies .
You could say who was there , nobody could remember where they were sitting there .
So you could n't get the bodies .
A tragedy behind the other .
<unk> , sitting outside , a <unk> , in the middle of the cylinder , and I realized that with the eyes of their mind , I could see where I had been sitting at the eye of their mind , I could see where there was sitting in the painting .
I took the family of the <unk> hand to where they were their loved ones between the coral .
What I 'm going to say , in that moment is something that we all know more or less , and it 's that no matter if we 're not good to remember names or three numbers or <unk> numbers or the word of our colleagues , we have memory memory and <unk> .
If you tell you , I 'll tell you the first 10 words of the story that I 'm going to tell you from <unk> , it 's very likely to be very hard to do it .
But I 'm going to tell you that if you would tell you who I was sitting on the horse on the <unk> , it would be capable of <unk> .
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember . The more crazy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This is a advice that comes from over 500 years ago , to the first <unk> of memory .
And how does it work ?
Let 's tell you , you have been known to the TED stage to give a talk , and they want to do it from memory , the same way we would have done if he would be done if you 've made it me , if they 've got it .
What you could do is imagine that they are in the door of his house .
And you know some of a sort of picture of absolutely ridiculous , crazy and mammals to help you remember that the first thing I want to mention is that completely <unk> .
And then you can imagine in their home , and see the <unk> of the <unk> , and see the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that I 'm going to tell you to give her a friend of <unk> .
And then you would see it up to tell you that my favorite mine who want to tell you .
And then in the kitchen , and the fourth topic of the which would be that journey that would be that journey that made by a whole year , and they have some friends to help you help me .
So , it 's like the <unk> , not word by word , not word for word , which is going to photograph it , but a typical of a typical .
In fact , the typical term '' comes from the <unk> `` <unk> , '' which means `` <unk> . ''
It 's a <unk> of when people thought in the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of public terms .
And the phrase `` In the first place , '' would be like the first place in their memory .
I saw that this was just fascinating , and I got back to come back from it .
I went to some of these services of memory , and I had the idea of writing something in this kind of <unk> about this kind of <unk> .
But there was a problem .
The problem was that a competition of memory is a simple event .
Actually , it 's like to see a lot of people sitting to a lot of people , I mean , that the most exciting thing that happens is when you get it in front .
I 'm a journalist and I need to write about something .
Yes , there 's amazing things happening in the minds of these people , but I do n't have access .
I realized that if I was going to tell this story , I needed to try to put it in their place .
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning , before I actually see the New York Times , just trying to see something .
Maybe a poem , or the names of a old where a number of a number I 'll read in a <unk> market .
And I found that this was <unk> .
I would have to be able to realize it .
It was fun , because it 's not just to train the memory .
What is actually about to do it is to improve the ability to create and imagine these beautiful images , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , '' and thank you <unk> .
I was pretty much with this .
This is me , using my art team for the memory of memory .
It 's a couple of <unk> , and some of the security of security in the ceiling , then they were only two <unk> , because the river is the worst enemy of a memory .
He ended back back to the same band that had been taken a year before . I had the idea that could grow up , in a sort of experiment .
I thought , I thought this could be able to be able to get all my research .
The problem was that the experiment came to control .
And I won the paper , something I did n't have to happen .
Of course , it 's a nice power , and the numbers of phone , and they go to a foot , but the reality is not the point .
These are so wrong .
Because you 're based in principles about how the brain works .
And it 's not necessary to be able to build the memory of memory or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're often talking about people with a great memory as if it was a great memory as if it was a gift of a gift .
It 's great .
At the most basic level , you remember when we move attention .
<unk> when we 're very deeply .
And the knowledge of memory -- these techniques of memory , they are only measuring .
In fact , we do n't even get out of the truth .
They work because they do <unk> .
<unk> a species of deep systems , a sort of attention , that most of us do n't go up by there .
But the reality is that there 's not .
So , it 's like things they do .
And if there 's something I want to go on today , it 's what <unk> , the <unk> that I could n't even remember that I had a problem of memory , I left me to me , which is the notion of life is the story of our memories .
How we 're willing to realize about what it 's in the <unk> of the <unk> , or Honey , not paying attention to be the human being in the front of us , who goes to our side .
I learned from the first hand that there are responsible for amazing memory in all of us .
But if you want to live a <unk> life , you have to be the kind of person who reminds remember .
Thank you .
Today I 'll talk about the last 30 years of the story of architecture .
It 's a lot to fly in 18 minutes .
It 's a complex issue , so it 's a complex issue : New Jersey .
Because 30 years ago , I 'm going to go from TED , I had six years ago , and lived there in home from my parents in a village , and this was my bedroom .
In the corner , from my bedroom , I was the bathroom that I did with my sister .
And between my bedroom and the bathroom , there was a smile that I was going to be .
And there were all the time looking at the shoulder , so every time I was from my room to the bathroom , you know , and every time I 'm going to get up and he ended up in a towel , you know me .
And I was that .
It was reasonable , and it was a bit of it .
Now , I saw that journey , I asked that , I asked that room and that house .
That 's the architecture .
You know .
Those animals , those emotions that I felt , that 's the power of architecture , because architecture is not about math , but the architecture is not about , of those connections , but of those connections , we feel in the places that we do .
And it 's not , you know , it 's going to be able to make it from that way , because of it , with the <unk> <unk> for the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under ceiling .
Or it 's , 90 percent of the time we 're able to protect architecture .
That 's very much .
The architecture tells us in ways we do n't even know .
That makes us a little bit , and very fast .
This means that when I show you a building like this , I know what I 'm going to tell you , you think about `` power '' '' and `` democracy '' '' '' ''
And I know what you think about it in a building built a half years per day .
This is a trick .
It 's a <unk> that use the architects to create a emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings .
It 's a emotional connection ; we 've used this trick from a lot , long time .
We use 200 years to build cells .
We use it in the 19th century to build art .
And in the 20th century in the U.S. , we use it to build houses .
Look , these <unk> <unk> , equality , in the sea , after the elements .
This is very , very useful , because we build things .
It 's expensive , it takes a long time and it 's very complicated .
People who are building . The <unk> and governments , you always have afraid to innovation , and they would have to use ways you know that they 're going to work .
So we found with buildings like this .
It 's a beautiful building .
And it 's the <unk> <unk> , in my city , and , you know , it has a cell ; it has this <unk> , and it 's a dome ; it has this wrong thing , they have this wrong thing .
But it does n't have a lot to see with a library .
That same year , in 2004 , the other side of the country , he ended up another library , which looks like this .
It 's in Seattle .
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era .
It 's a new kind of a public group for the city , a place to come up , read and share .
So , how it 's possible that in the same year , in the same country , two buildings , both <unk> , are so different ?
And the answer is that the architecture works in the beginning of compression .
In a side of it is innovation ; the architects who are all new technologies , new technologies , new solutions for the world of life life .
<unk> , we 'll be able to be able to get so much , that makes us very much of people .
All of black , this is you . You know , you believe that we feel very well , but we 're dead , but we do n't have another option .
We have to go to the other hand and go to connect with those symbols .
So we do , and we 're all happy , but we are all happy , but we 're really happy as <unk> , so we start to experience again , we 're doing it , and so we 've made it in the past 300 years , and of course , in the last 10 years , and unfortunately , in the past 30 years .
Well , it 's a 30 years of the 1970s .
The architects were writing with the <unk> `` <unk> . ''
It has to see with the sound .
You can guess .
<unk> , in scale .
Something really hard .
So , we go to the '80s , and we started using those symbols .
We 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it on the other direction .
We take those ways we know and the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and we use new materials .
I love .
We do n't give them <unk> .
We took the <unk> , and we can put it in Iceland , that you can be <unk> by the glass of glass .
The ways are <unk> , they were born in campus .
They get it in furniture .
They were born to the size of the buildings .
A honest .
But they were the '80s , that was great .
We all got the way in international rights , we went to the neighborhoods , and there , in the mountains , we can create our own healthy .
Those drugs could be to the Mediterranean , to the <unk> , or the angle .
You know , with a <unk> of bread .
This is what happens with the <unk> .
This is what happens with the symbols .
They 're easy , they 're a healthy , because in a new spaces , we 're adding some of other places .
I know very well , and you know , that this is not .
This is Ohio .
The architects are feel about , and we started to do it , and we started to make it out of the new direction in the other direction .
In the '80s and the principles of the 90 , we started thinking with the <unk> <unk> .
And we 're going to get the Cambridge symbols ; we now have to have a new techniques of design design , and we found it with new appearance , a few ways that 's going to be involved with other ways .
This is academic and <unk> , and it 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> .
Now unfortunately , the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction .
But then , it happened something .
In Italy , it 's taken this building .
And it 's the <unk> , from Frank syndrome .
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture .
Paul <unk> said , it was one of those bad moments when obesity , and the public and public public in general , they were completely in a building .
The day New York Times <unk> this building building .
The subset of 2030 in a half percent when they ended up the building .
So , suddenly , all the world I wanted one of those buildings : Los Angeles , Seattle , Chicago , New York City .
All the world wanted you , and he was everywhere .
He was our first architect star .
But how it 's possible that these forms , and it 's , and this is , how it 's possible , and how it 's possible to get in the world ?
And it happened , because of the media , they can be able to learn that those forms of the physical forms and tourism .
We 've created a emotional reaction with these ways .
And the same made the key of the world .
So , you know , if they had these ways , they had culture and monitor .
This phenomenon of the new country 's new country with other architects .
And I went to argue , and what happened with these few architects , and what happened with these few architects in the building again , actually started going to happen with all the architecture . The digital media started to be able to be able to increase the speed of energy consumption .
Think about , for example , how they lose architecture .
A thousand years ago , you would have to go to the next people to see a building .
It 's coming up , you can take a boat , a plane , you can be healthy .
The technology goes up . You can see in the family , and at the end , and at the end , we all are true of architecture , and the building is more there from their physics .
The architecture is in every parts now , that means that the speed of the communications finally has been around the speed of architecture .
Because that architecture moves so fast .
It 's not a long time to think about a building .
It needs a lot of time to build a building , three or four or four years ago , and in that time , a architect can design two , eight , or 100 buildings more , before if I designed it four years .
Because there 's never really good feedback in architecture .
So it 's like we found with buildings like this .
The <unk> was not a movement of two years ago , but in 20 years .
For 20 years , we were building buildings like this because we did n't have no idea of how much the <unk> .
That 's never going to go back to happen , I think , because we 're in the threshold of the most revolution in the architecture from the <unk> invention , of the steel , and it 's the revolution of media .
My theory is that when you have the advent of the communication media , it starts to be able to be able to be in both more fast , until you get to be in both the difference between innovation , and it 's a symbol of the difference between innovation and symbol , and you know , the public .
Now , we can actually make these symbols , with a emotional sense of something completely new .
I 'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended recently recently .
We were <unk> to put this building that came up .
This is the center of a village called <unk> Street , in the state of New York .
It 's a <unk> community .
But that was a few years before you get the building , it was a part of the community , and as the drawings was made exactly the dark product , there was no surprises .
The building was going to be part of the community , the first summer , when people started to get , and what I looked at the social media , the building left back to be only a building , it became a heart of communication , because these are not only images from a building , they are the images that you did .
And as you use it to tell their story , you get in part of the personal narrative , and that does n't be able to do with the collective memory , and we 'll use these symbols , we learn .
It 's going to say , we do n't need to tell you how to think architecture .
We can tell you each other what we think of architecture , because the digital media is n't only changed the relationship between us , but they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings .
Now think about a second in those Germans .
If that building is built today , first to the Internet in how to the Internet as well . ''
Now , we 've been able to try with examples , of innovation , what can be a library .
That 's amazing .
<unk> that you can take to the mayor , to people , and tell you that there 's no answer to what it can be a library today .
Let 's give you part of this .
This new solutions of solutions the freedom of experience .
Everything is different now .
The architects are not those creatures that use words , and writing things , and one is not a public public that does n't know something that you do n't know before .
People can listen to , and you do n't go up by the architecture .
That means that the advent of <unk> <unk> , from a movement to another movement , it 's <unk> .
In fact , we can go back and find solutions right to the problems that create society .
This is the end of the story of architecture , and it means that the buildings of the morning are very different to the buildings of today .
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only , and it turned to the measure of a modern city .
Now , this means that one <unk> , it can be that , a <unk> , and not a bad man in Brooklyn , and it 's not a bad man in the bottom of what they should be a column .
This means that a lot of robots can be able to build our buildings , because we finally get ready for the ways they 're going to produce .
That means that the buildings are going to be able to get the <unk> of nature and not the opposite .
Now , this means that a quarter of a parking parking phone , Florida , also can be able to make me to do , or it 's also going to do , or even one can put there in the night .
This means that three architects can dream with me in the New Museum of New York City , and to bring a half million dollars from the community of that cause , it 's not a client .
It means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little <unk> of <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> as animals you 're going to look at .
Because it does n't matter if it 's a cow or a robot who uses our buildings .
It does n't matter how we build , what matters is what we built .
People know how to make buildings buildings , more smart and more good .
We 've been waiting to all of you .
Finally , we 're not in the whole sides .
It 's a architect , <unk> , and we used to make better buildings , better cities , for a better world , because there 's a lot of game .
The buildings is not only aware of our society , but they give you to the most small spaces : the local <unk> , the homes where we see our children , and the step of the bedroom .
Thank you very much .
This is my garage , <unk> .
I was able to give you a year and he started walking .
And what 's a great way , a typical of the children of a year , <unk> , like your body was moving too fast for their legs .
It 's completely beautiful .
And one of the things that we like to do for the moment of the mirror .
She really love their reflex .
It 's going up and <unk> , and you know , I 'm going to know , and you know , I 'm going to know , and you know .
It 's beautiful .
No , all their friends do this , and my mom told me that I used to do it , and I made it thinking : When I couple of doing this ?
How is that we 've got to do with our appearance ?
Because it 's not like .
Every month , 10 people on Google , `` I 'm sorry ? ''
This is <unk> , it 's 13 years ago and live .
And as a little bit of a teenager , you can only want to be altruism , and we can face .
It 's given by night .
It 's sent to the next week in school .
It 's a little bit of fear , it 's a little bit of fear , because when his mom tells us all the time that 's beautiful , every day in school , somebody says that it 's chaos .
And what his mom said , and what his friends , or they gave them from the school , you say , not know who believe .
So , it makes a video of it , and he got back to the YouTube , and he said to others that please give a comment , `` I 'm a beautiful or I 'm sorry ? ''
Well , until now , you 've got to get more than 13 .
Some of these are so easy , that you do n't even listen to think about them .
Let 's talk about a small teenager , normal and air , that you get these answers in one of the number of their most vulnerable life .
They are a lot of people like this , in your kids girls trying to communicate from this way .
But what do you do this ?
Well , the teenagers of this almost never .
They 're low pressure to be in line and available all the time , talking , <unk> , you know , we 're going to say , and you know , it 's doing it .
You 've never been so connected , in fact , so you know , as young .
As a mother told me , `` It 's like that there 's a party in his room every night . ''
There 's not not privacy .
And the social pressures that you go from the hand with that .
This environment , of being always connected , it 's <unk> to our children in the number of the number of `` I like , '' who have and the kinds of <unk> they get .
There 's no record between a life , and the real life .
It 's really hard to know the differences between what it 's real or what is not .
And it 's also , it 's very hard to know the difference between what it 's true and what it 's invented .
What is the more <unk> in the life of someone who is a normal context ?
And where are you looking for the inspiration ?
Well , you can see the kind of images that are born from the news of girls .
It 's going to be zero on your <unk> .
The technique of the <unk> is now a sign .
And yet as , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
To those <unk> , <unk> means <unk> .
These kinds of women in the popular culture of today .
It 's not hard to see with the young people .
But the kids are not going to this .
As the stars of the stars , and the <unk> <unk> .
But what is the problem with everything ?
Well , we probably want to do that our children can be healthy and they are individuals .
But in a whole culture for the image , we 're waiting to our children to spend more time and effort to protect their appearance , the price of all the other aspects of their identity .
Things like their relationships , the development of their physical capabilities , their studies and other things begin to get .
six of every 10 girls would do n't do something because you think you do n't see it enough enough .
These are not available activities .
They are fundamental activity for their growth as human beings , and as we used to society and the world 's field .
Two percent , almost one of every three teenagers are not interested in the dignity of class . You 've got to participate in the dignity of classroom because they do n't want to call attention by their physical behavior .
One of every five , you 're not going to go in all over the day when they do n't feel with it .
And in the case of course , if you do n't think you can see the good enough , specifically if you do n't believe you are good enough , you get a note to the average of your colleagues who are not care about that .
And this phenomenon has fallen in Finland , the United States and China .
And the day of what you 're going to get these young people .
So , for course , for course , we 're talking about as you you see , not how you 're really .
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the economic performance .
And it 's also <unk> health .
The teenagers with a time in least activity , they eat less men and vegetables , in more likely to make you to be healthy , you can not get to give you to be able to give you .
They have low self-esteem .
They are more easily <unk> by people who are on and they are in greater risk .
And we think it 's all about this why they take more <unk> decisions , like the consumption of peace and drugs , DNA surgery , sex and without protection and without protection .
Now , the perfect body is providing to the health health system , and our government costs thousands of billion dollars every year .
And we do n't know it .
They 're going to get you to do again , except of if you have or not the biggest rate of the <unk> .
The 17 percent of women do n't use a interview interview in a day that they do n't feel with the way as you see .
Think about a moment in what this is doing our economy .
If we could do this , what would be that opportunity ?
We 're going to get this potential is in interest for each of us .
But how do we do that ?
Well , talking , I do n't be very far .
Not good .
If you really want to change things , you have to do something .
And we 've learned that there 's three ways . The first is we have to make trust in their own body .
We have to help our videos to develop strategies to make the pressure of the right images and build their self-esteem .
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it .
The bad news is that most of these do n't work .
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of a lot of all of us , not to realize , we get the situation .
So , we need to tell you that the program that they 're not going to do a positive impact , but also a impact .
And the studies of research show that the best programs are done in six areas . The first is the influence of family , friends and relationships .
These six aspects are points to make you to give you a education in the body in climate climate change .
One education is fundamental , but they 're going to get this problem with each of us to take the whole thing in the issue , and we can be a best model to go for women and girls in our own lives .
I 'm able to be able to be able to be a sense of like women are , and I got to share in our circles .
It 's not good to tell you with the <unk> of our political , or the size of their <unk> , or that 's going to make it , or the success of a <unk> athlete depends on the fact that is not a great beauty .
We need to start to lose people through what they are , not as you see .
We all can start doing it , because we can start doing it by the kind of images of images , and so that we put in our social networks .
We can take the people in their effort and their actions and not in their appearance .
And let me ask you : When it was the last time I 'll get a mirror ?
In short , we have to work together as communities , as governments and as companies , to change our own culture , so that our children can be able to get all their person , and the diversity , the diversity .
We have to put the people who 's really providing the difference in a cure .
To make a difference in the real world , we do that they get them on the great screen because we just make a different world .
A world in where our children are free to become the best version of them , where the way that they believe that you can see the <unk> of being who are , or to get what they want to do in their lives .
Think what this can mean for someone in their lives .
Who have in mind ?
You ?
He did her sister ?
So his daughter ?
Do you put it ?
It could be just the woman who 's going to go to two legs of distance , what would be going to be able to her if it was taken out of that voice in their inside of that voice in their inside , which you know , by not to have a long legs , I feel more small .
What would you be for her , if we do this , and we 're looking at this , and you do n't get it to their potential of that way ?
Now , the <unk> of our culture with the images with the images of us .
But we 'll get our children the truth .
You know , the way you see is just a part of your identity , and the truth is that the truth is that we love , and by what they do n't feel .
<unk> in the <unk> in our schools .
Let 's put each of us , the way we talked about and we get up with other people .
And we used together as a community , from small groups to governments , so that the little <unk> of a age of the age of today , they will get in sexual change .
Let 's do .
The five of China , a gentleman called <unk> <unk> to a hotel in Manhattan , and he would put to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the leader of the <unk> Bank .
And I 'm going to find it out of it , but it 's going to come up by the <unk> , but it 's going to come up by the <unk> , in company company started to be able to be able to be able to plan by a few of the United Nations , including Marshall and the United Nations .
Now , so , so we got those communities , by a <unk> of the FBI .
Sadly , the <unk> <unk> in the World Center , they could n't eat .
At the late afternoon , it would be hired by their participation in that .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Germany , it 's being a <unk> engineer , with a <unk> , with a American mother , <unk> of school school .
Just when I was seven years ago , our family started to change .
My father taught me a way of Islam , which very a few , even most of the researchers , they get to know .
So I saw that when people spend time to interact , you do n't have a lot to get the same things in life .
But yet , in all of religion , in all human group , there 's always a little bit of people who would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make all the media , so you think there is that we use all the media media for that all lived as they
Now , a lot of months earlier , I felt with me , and I thought that in the last week of week , he 's and some friends , had been going to be going to because of it in New Street , for practice .
He told me that I come up with him the next day .
And I got to <unk> <unk> <unk> that , I did n't know our group , I was born by the FBI .
When I 'm going to go up , my father gave me to get up on the shoulder , and I looked at how to the goal to the goal of about 30 meters .
And that day , with the last <unk> that I gave the small light on the goal , and for surprise from all , especially mine , all of mine , all of mine , all of mine .
My uncle became the other and in China , he said `` <unk> <unk> . ''
As a parent , a son .
Now , you know , the <unk> would have a lot of laughter , but just a few years later I understood what it was so funny .
I looked at me , the same level of destruction that my father could be able to play .
Those people later would be told by put up with the <unk> kilos in the 1970s in the World tower in the World tower Center , causing a explosion that came back to six people and participate in other 1,000 people and put back in other 1,000 .
I went to those men .
He called `` <unk> , '' which means .
When I was 19 , I had to take 20 times . That 's responsible for my childhood , not allowed me to do a lot .
Every time I was starting to try to feel about someone was a moment of <unk> , and let 's go to another city .
As I always was a new face of the kind of <unk> was a victim of <unk> .
The secret <unk> my identity to avoid the white , but it 's the new of the class , and it 's the new of the class , and it was enough .
So the highest part of the time in home reading books , seeing television or playing games .
For these reasons , we do n't found social skills , to say , and they would say , we were not prepared for the real world .
I 'm going to tell you to tell people , with the basis in 45 minutes , as their race or their religion .
So , how I could open the eyes ?
One of the first experiences that they had to test my own way to think , it was during the <unk> elections of 2000 .
In a <unk> program in the National Street , in Philadelphia .
My group is <unk> in the topic of violence , like I had been a victim of <unk> , was something for what I felt a lot of passion .
The members of this group came from a lot .
One day , in the end of the Desert , I found that one of the kids with who we had done .
And I took a few days , and I realized that there was not not no longer between the two .
I 've never had a few friend and frankly me , I felt very proud of I had been able to drive the enemy that all of the life was made me believe that it was <unk> .
Now , another key moment came when I got a work of summer in Bush Bush , a park .
I found with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures , that experience changed in the development of my character .
All of the life , I had taught me that the <unk> was a sin , and by the wall , all the gay were bad .
I had the opportunity to work with young actors there , in a show , and I could see that several of them were the most kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of people who had seen in life .
Now , it 's a little bit of child , we found a sense of empathy to the suffering of others , but it 's not easy to me to try to try to try to treat people , exactly the way as I would be able to be done .
And so I could photograph the advice that I had been taught from a child , with the experience of interaction in real life .
I do n't know how it 's going to be , but I know what it 's going to be , but I know what it 's going to be in the most there of my control .
And then he came to the `` Wow . ''
All of the night , Eric Stewart would have to be honest about my <unk> , and I 'll try to see that the race of people , religion or sexual sex or sexual sex , you do n't have nothing to see with the character .
In a lot of ways he came up my own way in a moment that I was extremely <unk> .
In times , the inspiration can come from the unexpected . And that a <unk> student had had a best influence in my life that my own parent , he was not in sure .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think , and she said something I understood in my heart , and she said something I understood in my heart .
She looked at the old eyes of somebody who has been able to be enough with <unk> <unk> and said , `` I 'm tired of writing . ''
In that moment , I realized about how much energy energy needs to keep all that I 'm going to keep all that I love in your place .
My real name is not <unk> <unk> .
He changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life .
So , why I decided to go and put it in a risk ?
Well , it 's simple .
I 've done because I hope somebody , some day , who 's going to take the violence to the violence , I can hear my story and understand that there 's a best road , which I do n't have to give me a better road .
On the opposite , I decided to use my experience to fight the terrorism and against them .
I do that for the victims of terrorism , and by their kids , and by the terrible pain and the support that the terrorism has produced in their lives .
Now , by the victims of terrorism , to talk about those acts without sense , like to prevent the actions of my father .
With this one of this , I 'm going to get it out here as a test , which violence is not to make any religion or death , which kids do n't have to keep the library of their parents .
I 'm not my father .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you very much .
In this moment , there 's a movie that 's happening in their minds .
It 's a amazing film .
It 's in 3D , and it has sound sound of what you hear and see right now , but that 's only the beginning .
Your film has to say , well and dangerous .
It sounds your body , your pain , your pain , you do .
It 's got emotions , they come and happiness .
It 's got a memories , as moments of your childhood who 's going to do with your eyes .
And it has all all a voice in your lack of certain thinking .
The heart of the movie is you who lose everything in a lot .
This film is your lack of consciousness , the subject of the experience of mind and the world .
The consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human .
Every one of us is aware .
We all have a film , you know , you and you .
There 's no anything that we get more directly .
On least , I know I have a own consciousness .
I do n't know that you are aware .
The consciousness is also the reason to live .
If you do n't have aware , anything in our lives , or value .
But at the same time , it 's the most <unk> phenomenon of the universe .
Why are we aware ?
Why do we have these films ?
Why is we not only robots that <unk> what we 've got to produce outcomes without experience the movie film ?
In this moment , nobody knows the answers to those questions .
I thought that to predict consciousness to science , you need to have a few ideas .
Some people say that it 's impossible a science of consciousness .
The science , for nature , it 's true .
The consciousness , by nature , it 's dangerous .
So you can never have a science of consciousness .
Because for almost all the 20th century , you 'll get that vision .
Life with psychology , the neuroscience in the brain , in the brain , in the brain , but never just mention consciousness .
Even 30 years ago , when TED started , there was very a few jobs about consciousness .
Before , 20 years ago , everything started to change .
<unk> as a <unk> , and physicists as Craig <unk> said , `` Now , it 's the moment for the moment that the consciousness is . ''
And since there , there was a real explosion , a <unk> of the scientific work in consciousness .
And this work was great . It was great .
But it 's also a fundamental limitations to the moment .
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years , it was the pursuit of 2030 , based between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness .
We saw something of this guy in the amazing work that I was born Reagan 's a few minutes .
Now we understand a lot better , for example , the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or really happy .
But this is going to be a science science .
It 's not a science science .
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of experiences , but we do n't know why .
I 'd like to explain it saying that this kind of work in neuroscience says some questions that we want to teach consciousness . The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain , and with what it 's changed .
But in a sense , those are the easy problems .
I do n't try to make it .
In fact , there 's no good problems with consciousness .
Well , I do n't know the real mystery of the central mystery of this matter : why all the physical process in the brain has to be on the consciousness ?
Why is there a movie film ?
In this moment , we do n't understand it .
And you can say , I 'll take a few years to neuroscience .
It 's going to be going to turn in another physical phenomenon as the <unk> , like the life , and we 're going to find explanation .
Now , the result of us are all of a few behaviors , how do we try to make the way , how they work , how they do it , and how they do it , they 're able to make them , and it 's all of the living organisms .
And that could n't be the human brain to explain some behavior , and the functions of the human brain as a human phenomenon : how to get it , how we do , how do we do , how do we do , how do we do , how do we have a curiosity .
But when it 's about consciousness , the questions about behavior are between the easy problems .
But the hard problem , it 's the question of why is that the question of why is that it 's about a negative experience ?
And here is , the standard paradigm paradigm , the standard paradigm of neuroscience , actually still does n't have a lot to say .
I 'm a heart of heart .
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that work . So , for a long time , I took me the head against the wall for a theory of consciousness in a theory of consciousness in a simple theory that would work .
But at the end , I got to the conclusion that that does n't work for reasons .
I think we 're going to do in this point .
We have a wonderful line of wonderful , great , we 're going to get it to this ; the physics shows the chemistry , the chemistry shows the biology , the biology shows part of psychology .
But consciousness does n't seem to be able to face in this room .
On the one side , it 's a fact that we are aware .
On another , we do n't know how a idea of our scientific view of the world .
I think the consciousness , right now , it 's a sort of <unk> , something we need to predict our view of the world , but we do n't know how .
With a <unk> like this , you can have ideas ideas . And I think we need to be ideas that at the beginning , but I think we need to deal with the consciousness of a scientific way .
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas .
My friend will give you , which is here today , it has one .
Their idea is that there 's not there a hard problem of consciousness .
All of the idea of the entire movie film is a kind of illusion or confusion .
In fact , what you have to do , is to explain the technology , the brain behaviors , and so we found everything that needs explanation .
Well , more power for him .
That 's the kind of cultural idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of human consciousness , based in the brain .
In the same time , for me , and for many other , that vision is pretty close to just where the concept of consciousness is significantly .
But I 'm in a different direction .
In the time that 's , I want to explore two ideas that I think you can be done .
The first idea of crazy is that consciousness is important .
The physicists sometimes you take some of the universe as much fundamental things : space , the time and the mass .
We 'll have the fundamental laws that we 've got , as the laws of religion or quantum mechanics .
These laws and fundamental properties does n't explain in terms of nothing more basic .
At the opposite , you think fundamental , and that 's going to get the world .
Sometimes , the list of the fundamental thing is going .
In the 19th century century discovered that you can not explain the physical phenomena in terms of fundamental fundamental concepts , space , time , mass laws , laws , laws of paper , and then we get the basic laws of the amygdala .
I think that 's the situation we found with consciousness .
If you ca n't explain the consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas , space , time , the mass , they 've got to get the list .
The most natural thing would be considered the same as a fundamental thing , a fundamental of nature .
Now , this does n't mean that a sudden is not object from science .
It 's not a road to make it scientifically .
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that determine consciousness , the laws of the laws , the laws of the fundamental concepts : space , the mass , the mass , the mass of physical brain .
The physicists sometimes you say , we want to want the fundamental laws so simple that we could be done in a <unk> .
The situation of consciousness is something like this .
We want to find the fundamental laws so simple that we can put it in a sign .
We do n't know what laws are , but that 's what we look at .
The second idea is that consciousness can be universal .
Every system can have a degree of consciousness .
This vision sometimes is called <unk> : `` Wow , '' by all , `` <unk> , '' by mind , not only humans , they do n't only humans , the dogs , the mice , the mice , the mice , the mice , the patients , even the microbes of adversity .
Even a lot of you have some of consciousness .
The idea is not that the magic are smart or you think .
It 's not that a person can be full of Caltech when you think , `` Oh , it 's always traveling to the speed of light .
I can never fly and say , `` Happy . ''
No , not .
But the thinking is that you may have to have some element of critical feeling , meaning , some of consciousness , of consciousness .
This is a little bit for you .
How would you do something so crazy ?
In part of this comes from the first idea , which consciousness is something important .
If it 's fundamental , as space , the time and the mass , it 's natural , it 's natural , which can also be universal , like the other .
It 's also going to know that even though the idea is like <unk> , which is a lot less for people in different cultures , where the human mind seems more with nature .
One more deep reason comes from the idea that maybe the more simple way , and powerful laws to find the fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process , it 's <unk> consciousness with information .
You know , there 's the cost of information , there 's consciousness .
It 's a complex of <unk> , like in a human , consciousness .
It 's a simple information , simple consciousness .
Something very exciting is that in the recent years , <unk> <unk> , I took this kind of theory , and we found this kind of scientific methods .
It 's got a <unk> mathematics of the information , which is called <unk> , which is the <unk> of information in a system .
And they 're supposed to do with consciousness .
So in a human brain , there 's a amazing website of <unk> of information , a high website , a lot of consciousness .
In a mouse , there 's a <unk> , a half of information of information , very very significant , a very important degree .
But when you go to the appearance , microbes , we microbes , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The brain level of information is less , but it 's not zero .
In the theory of <unk> , there 's still a computer level of zero consciousness .
In fact , we made a fundamental law of consciousness : thanks to <unk> , high <unk> .
And here , another reason is that the <unk> can help us our consciousness to the physical world .
The physicists and the philosophers are often seen that physical is obvious .
With the structure of the reality using a lot of equations , but we do n't talk about the reality of the reality .
As it 's called Stephen <unk> , `` Where comes to the fire of the equations ? ''
From the vision <unk> the equations of physics you can stop as they are , but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness .
That 's what the physicists do basically , they know the flow of consciousness .
According to this vision , consciousness is what you get fire in the equations .
In that vision , consciousness is not in the physical world as a sort of <unk> .
It 's there in the center .
This vision , I think , the <unk> vision , it has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature , and it can have social , and it can have social consequences .
You can be <unk> .
I used to think that I did n't want to eat anything that I had consciousness , then I had to be a button .
If you 're a <unk> and you see that vision , you 'll have a lot of fun .
I think it 's a good thing , this tends to transform your thinking , while what it matter in terms of the individual , and it 's the moral , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the importance and their complexity .
It 's also natural ask by consciousness in other systems , like computers .
What is there about the artificial intelligence system in the film `` <unk> '' ?
Is it aware ?
According to the vision of the <unk> information , she has a different amount of information , integrated , so that the answer is yes , if it 's aware .
If this is right , they have a pretty easy problems about the development of the development of computers , and the <unk> of <unk> .
Finally , you can ask it by the consciousness of recording , the planet .
Canada has your own consciousness ?
Or in a local level , a specific group , like the audience in a TED talk . And in this moment , we have a TED consciousness , a whole film for this full of TED group , different of the films of each other ?
I do n't know the answer to that question , but I think , at least is a question that it needs to be serious .
So , here 's a <unk> vision , and I do n't know if it 's right .
In fact , I 'm actually sure of the first idea of the first idea , which consciousness is something important , which of the second , which is universal .
The vision shows a lot of questions , a lot of challenges , like , how these young stories of thinking about the kind of human consciousness that we know and love .
If we can answer those questions , then I think we go through the right road to a theory of consciousness .
If you do n't , well , probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy .
We ca n't wait to solve the night at the morning .
But I think we were going to discover .
Take consciousness is the real key , I think , to understand the universe and to treat ourselves .
Maybe we only need the bad idea .
Thank you .
I grew up in a small village in <unk> .
I had a very normal , a part of education .
I went to school , I was <unk> with my friends , I was <unk> with my sisters .
Everything was very normal .
And when I was 15 years ago , a member of my community came up to my parents , because I wanted to <unk> it for a prize .
And my parents said , `` Well , that 's very good , but there 's there there 's a bad problem .
She 's actually not seen anything . ''
I went to school , I had a good notes . After school , I had a chair in the <unk> of my mother , and he was a lot of time looking at the series of `` The <unk> <unk> '' '' and `` You know , `` You know it 's <unk> . ''
Yes , I know it .
But they were right .
I did n't do anything that was extraordinary in all .
You know , I can be able to be able to be like a plan if we take the disability of the equation .
Man later , I was in the second part of the school in a high school school , so after about 20 minutes in the 45 minutes in the 11 of studies , a kid called the hand and said , `` Hey , when you explain your speech ? ''
And I said , `` What ? ''
Well , I had been talking about the law 's law by a few minutes .
And he said , `` You know , you know , your speech speech .
When people in chairs , talk about things in school ? ''
`` Please , in the general room . ''
And it was then when I realized : This child had had experiences with people with <unk> objects .
And we do n't know it . And it 's not , this is , that 's true for many of us .
To us , people with disability is not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk> .
We are not real people . We 're there to be there for you .
And , in fact , I 'm in this stage , I 'm going to go to what I do in this wheelchair , and probably you are waiting to be waiting .
Well , ladies , ladies and gentlemen , I 'm afraid .
I 'm not here for <unk> .
I 'm here to tell you that you 've got to tell you that we 've experienced in relationship to disability .
Yes , you have to get the one of that the disability is a single bit of it , and it 's going to go up .
It 's a bad thing and live with a disability .
It 's not a bad thing , and you do n't have to ask you .
And in the last years , we 've been able to move even more about this kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of social communication .
It 's possible to have seen images like this , `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this another thing : `` His excuse is <unk> .
Or this another thing : `` Before I would go . ''
These are only a couple of examples , but there 's there is a great amount of them .
It may be that you 've seen one , from the child without a <unk> hand with a pencil for the mouth .
You may have seen a child who 's going to take a child that did with a little bit of carbon .
And there 's a lot of these images , which are what we call inspiration .
And they use the big list , you know , <unk> to a group of people for the benefit of other people .
So , in this case , <unk> the <unk> in the benefits of people without disability .
And the purpose of these images is , and we could see , so we can see and thinking , `` Well , very bad that 's my life , could be worse .
I could be that person . ''
But if you are that person ?
I 've lost the number of the number of times that I 've got a little bit like to express me that I believe that I believe that I think I 'm happy or a source of inspiration , and this happens to before that my work had a public .
It was like if I 'm going to go up for the morning and remember my own name , and this is <unk> .
These images , those images <unk> the people with risk of people without disability .
They are there for you , and think that things are not so bad for you , or to put their own jobs in perspective .
And the life as you use it is actually hard .
Let 's take some things .
But the things that we 've done is not the things that you can think .
They are not kind of unexpected things to our bodies .
I use the term `` people . ''
So I 've lived in this body for a long time .
I 'm very <unk> with him .
So the things I need to do , and I 've learned to get the best of their capacity as you do it , and that 's what happens with the children of those pictures also .
They are not doing anything of the common .
They 're just using their bodies to take the best of their capacity .
So , it 's really <unk> in the way we do , when we do those images ?
When people says , `` You 're a source of inspiration , '' which says like a <unk> .
And I know why happens .
It 's the cause of the view , because you 've got this kind of one of the disability that makes us care .
And unfortunately , I do n't do it .
And I know what you 're thinking .
I 'm here <unk> the inspiration , and you think , `` Why you think , `` Why you think , `` Why you think , `` Please , you know , `` Well , God , you know , `` Why do you do it . ''
And actually , I know what I 'm .
Now , some of other people in all time .
But yet , I do n't know that I 'm more likely to do .
Now , you know , it 's about a great idea to use a big idea to take the things that 's going to get the things that you go .
Wow .
We learn of the force , and it 's resistance from the other , not against our bodies and our fears , but against a world that <unk> and we get it .
I really think that 's a exercise that we 've got about the disability is the biggest alphabet .
We makes us life hard .
And that quote , `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude , the reason that that 's probably a really true , because of the social model of disability .
A lot of them in a <unk> , you do n't have never done that it 's going to get it in a circle .
You do n't . You know to a television screen do n't have to come up the <unk> for people .
It 's not a lot of people in a half of a room , and it 's a positive attitude to turn all of those books .
Not not going to happen .
I want to live in a world where the disability is not the exception , but the norm .
I want to live where a girl 15 years ago , sitting in his bedroom watching `` <unk> <unk> <unk> , '' not , not <unk> from nothing to be in a chair .
I want to live in a world where we do n't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make people in the bed of the bed and remember our names in the morning and remember our names for the morning .
I want to live in a world where we value the amount of people in people with disability , and I want to live in a world where a child was a little bit that a kid in a high high high school school is not a little bit of that their high high school .
The disability does n't happen , but question what you think about to know about it , I know it .
Thank you .
What do you have to see reality , and the professional TV , with empathy ?
And what it 's the middle speed of a gun without a process ?
Unfortunately , today , now just answer one of those questions , so , please , not <unk> .
When people think about reality , you think about `` <unk> <unk> , '' and in my hands in the air , but the reality reality is not science fiction .
The reality reality is something that happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it , and people need to know , because reality needs to change our lives so as the Internet and mobile phones .
So , how do we get the reality of the reality ?
And the first step , it 's what I 'm going to go , `` The Google Google band .
I 'm sure that many are familiar with them .
What maybe you do n't know is that the Google Station are a device that allows you to see what I see .
And I 'll allow you to experience what it 's being a role in the field .
Now , right now , the only way to be in the field is that I want to <unk> .
I have to use words .
I have to create a system that you know with their imagination .
We can use the Google band , under a helmet and know what it 's going to run by the field of a game of play , the blood protect the ears .
We can know that a man of three kilos , we decided to get up with everything to be .
I 've been there , and I assure you that it 's not fun .
I 'm going to give you some videos to show you what is to use the Google band under the helmet , and give you a idea of that .
Unfortunately , it 's not images of the <unk> , because the idea of the <unk> of technology , is a metaphor to move to the surface , but we do what we can .
So let 's see a video .
Chris <unk> : Let 's go .
It 's almost <unk> .
And a moment .
Anybody ?
Let 's go !
Chris <unk> : As you can see , it 's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the entire field , from the <unk> perspective .
They have given to realize that they need people , the rest of the team .
We have a video of them , from the University of Washington .
<unk> of field : Five <unk> !
eight , eight ! Let 's go !
Chris <unk> : This is a little bit more than the feeling to be in the field , but it does n't have anything to be in the garden .
They want to make that experience .
They want to be in the field , to be their favorite players , and I 've got to ask me in YouTube and Twitter , `` You can see from the image of a <unk> .
Can you ?
We want to experience that . ''
One time we have that experience with <unk> and Google Station , how do we make it ?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> , which probably many you know .
<unk> <unk> has been known as the <unk> device never created , and it 's not <unk> .
And I 'm going to show you why , with this video .
Man : Oh , oh !
No , not ! I do n't want to go playing ! No !
Oh , God , God !
MK : That 's the experience of a man in a man in a <unk> .
What will be the experience of a fan when you get a video video video <unk> across the line , <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before in the arm , and do a place ?
When I can be <unk> for the <unk> , we 'll put the <unk> at the network of the network ? Or do you do it to make a <unk> .
What will be their experience when the one of a mountain at more than 100 miles as a magic call ?
Maybe you 're going to get it on the sales of them for adults .
But this is not really absurd .
It 's only virtual , <unk> .
How do we make reality reality , <unk> ?
And the reality reality , when you know , the <unk> , the <unk> and the people get the information of what people want to see and think , `` How do we use this to improve our teams ?
How do we use it to win ? ''
Because they always use the technology to win .
I like to win .
So , I 've been here a little bit about technology in the way .
In 2006 , the <unk> <unk> had a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> , so I would take faster .
They gave the <unk> .
Other teams decided to go up .
Most people saw the game because it was more exciting , faster .
In 1994 , the <unk> of the <unk> , and then in the <unk> of the field , and then in the <unk> of them .
They had more likely because it was more fast .
In <unk> , imagine that they 're going to go back to his group and you see their next to get up in front of you , in a plastic , in a plastic , they do n't have to try to forget about it .
or by the strategy .
They 're going to go to the field , and they do n't .
And let you want you to because if you do n't get their instructions , you get free , and they feel it up .
If you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
And they do n't want that .
But the reality reality is not just a <unk> <unk> .
The reality reality is also a way of building information and use it in real time to improve your face .
How do you do ?
Well , a very simple option would be having a camera on every corner of the videos , having a view of the people who 's below .
They also get information from the sensors of the emotions and the recovery , something that 's going to work .
And all of that information is going to give your players .
The good people can know .
You 'll have the bad need of information .
This <unk> the good of the bad workers .
So , your team team will be as important as you know , and the analysis of data will stop to be just for Caltech .
He will be also going to go up . Who would have you know ?
How would be in the field ?
Imagine that are the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the ball and <unk> .
I 'll be able to get a open <unk> . Suddenly , a transition in the left of your students , you 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , but that 's not the thing , but the system of <unk> , you do n't know , but the system of <unk> .
<unk> the area of protection .
Now , this shows you <unk> that there 's a open system .
<unk> the ball .
And the ball you see the light .
You do n't know where to land , but we do n't know where land looks like , because of course , the <unk> looks like , and it can change the career .
You know , it would be the ball , and it 's going to get it .
The public audience , and they 've made it all the <unk> from each point .
This is something that we create a huge emotion in the game .
I 'm going to give you a lot of people , because people want to live that experience .
They want to be in the field .
They want to be their favorite game .
The reality reality will be part of the pencil because it 's too useful for not .
But what I ask you is : we want to do this is the only use of the reality use ?
We 're going to use it as bread , and it 's like a bread , as our entertainment entertainment ?
Because I think we can use it for something more .
And I think we can use reality to be able to prevent the empathy between human beings , to show someone how is , literally , to be in the place of another person .
We know what this technology is going to be able to take it .
It takes thousands of millions of dollars a year .
But how much is about this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show you a <unk> , how they are that they are in the <unk> of the victim ?
How does this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to tell the world , how you 're living from it ?
How do it is also for a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , trying to be able to take a generation of children to think more in space and the science in time to think more on the space and the science in time .
Ladies and gentlemen , reality is about .
The questions we do , the decisions that we do , and the challenges we face , they 're available , as well .
Thank you .
I found me after 23 years in the <unk> <unk> of California .
The majority of those 23 years ago , the country <unk> the South Pole of <unk> , which is the <unk> bridge .
And the bridge is a <unk> structure , it 's known by the <unk> of San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean , and their <unk> .
Now unfortunately , it 's also a second , it 's being a few of the most places in the world .
And the bridge 's bridge was open .
<unk> <unk> , a British boss to build the bridge , he said , `` The bridge is almost a test test test .
The member of the bridge from the bridge is not not useful . ''
But from their openness , more than people have lost their death from the bridge .
Some of you believe between the two towers , we 'll take another dimension to another dimension , this bridge has sort like as well , maybe the every one of him would get you from all your face and pain , and the water who go down .
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make it .
After one of a free of four to five seconds , the body against the water in about five miles per hour .
The impact goes on the bones , some of the ones , some of the <unk> .
People die in the impact .
They do n't know it in the <unk> water , and then you get up .
I do n't think that the <unk> method is going to realize about the death of the <unk> , which is going to go .
This is the wire .
Except around the two o'clock , there are 32 pounds of steel .
Here 's where most of the people are going to get back from life .
I can tell you for experience that once the person is in the edge , and in their most dark time , it 's very hard to get back .
I took this picture last year while this young day with a church looking at your life .
I want to tell you with joy that we had to be successful that day in order to come back on .
When I started to work in the bridge , we did n't have no sense .
<unk> to the road through these calls .
This was not just a lot of service to those who are <unk> , but the police also .
We 've got a long road since then .
Today , they were tired and psychologists get to the new brothers .
This is <unk> <unk> .
I met the 17 of Cambridge last year to get a call a call of a possible book sitting sitting in the center of the center .
<unk> , and when I got , I looked at you talking about with a president of the bridge 's bridge .
They had only 32 years ago , and there was walking back to here from New Jersey .
In fact , I had to go back to here two times before in New Jersey to try to talk about this bridge .
After about about a hour talking about us , we asked if we know the story of the <unk> box .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and he sent to the Earth with a box , and he said , `` Never , I never put that box . ''
Well , one day , the curiosity could be more than Richard , and she turned the box .
And so she came up , and it came up , and all of it , and all sorts of <unk> against the man .
The only thing in the box was the hope .
So let 's ask us , `` What if you get the box and do n't hope ? ''
They were able to go back to the right , and it was in the right , and it was .
This sort of sort of funny and <unk> in New Jersey had been able to get life .
I talked to the parents of these night , and I guess that when I was talking about them , it does n't seem to be very good , because the next day , the one of the family I was called to see what was .
The parents were going to tell you .
Now , the <unk> flow of the effects of a lot of people .
I 'm going to tell you these questions : What would you do if a member of your family , a friend or someone would be born ?
What would you say ?
<unk> what ?
In my experience , you do n't only have to talk , but you have to hear .
It 's going to understand .
No , <unk> , or you tell the person you know how it feels , because you probably do n't know .
Only there 's only there , you can be the point that you need .
If you think of someone is notes , you do n't have afraid of <unk> and do the question .
A way to ask the question is , `` Other in similar circumstances have thought about their life ; you have had these thoughts ? ''
<unk> to the person in front of your life , and it will be the point of right for them .
Other signs to look at : They know , I believe that things are terrible , and they never 're going to improve ; <unk> , believe that there 's no anything that you can do about , social social social ; and a whole set of interest in life .
I got this talk about this talk , just a couple of days ago , and I got a email from a lady , and I would like to be able to make it a letter .
She lost his son from January of this year , and I wrote this email , just a couple of days , and it 's with their clothes and let me get it to the child .
`` Hi , Kevin . I guess you are in the TED conference .
It needs to be a whole experience .
I 'm thinking that I should go to the bridge to the bridge of week .
I just wanted to give you a note .
I hope you can tell you a lot of people and go home talking about it to her friends who will tell their friends , so .
I 'm still quite overweight , but it 's the more moments of me to realize that 's not going to tell home .
Man was taken from <unk> to San Francisco to see the talk of the sex with his father in January .
He never got there .
I called the police of <unk> , and we 've got to get that as you 've got that night .
On the next morning , two authorities came to my house and I came from that the car car was below the bridge .
You 've seen it to jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon of the day .
Thank you very much to fight by those who can be able to be completely limited to fight for them .
Who does n't have been before without a real disease ?
It does n't have to be so easy to go with it .
My cars are with your fight .
And the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is supposed to be a test through our beautiful bay , not a dimension .
A nice week , <unk> . ''
I ca n't imagine the value that she started to go to the bridge and go to the road that his son took that day , and also the value to go back .
I 'd like to introduce you to a man , which I mean with hope and value .
The 11 o'clock of 2005 , I was going to a call called a radio called an radio call in the bridge of the bridge of the South tower .
I came up to the sidewalk , and I looked at this man , Kevin <unk> , in foot .
When I saw it , you 'll go out of the end , and they were able to get on that little tube that 's around the tower .
For the time and a half of the next time , I heard like Kevin talked about their depression and everything .
Kevin decided for her realize that day to go back on that cup and give life to life else .
When Kevin became , the <unk> .
`` This is a new life , a new life . ''
But I asked , `` What was what he made you come up and get my hope and life and life else ? ''
And you know what he said ?
He said , `` I 'm doing .
I 'm going to talk about , and they just do . ''
Shortly after that mountains , I got a letter of the mother 's mother , and I have that letter with me , and I 'd like to be <unk> .
`` Dear <unk> <unk> , I do n't put the events of the 11 of course , and you 're one of the reasons why Kevin happens to us .
I think , I think Kevin was going for help .
It 's been diagnosed with a mental disease for which has been called <unk> .
I 'm going to explain Kevin when I was a six months , completely unconscious from all of those conversations , but , thanks to God , now we know .
Kevin is in order , as the says .
We give you to God for God .
I 'm able to talk to you , <unk> <unk> . ''
And at the end , she said , `` <unk> . When I came up the Gulf of San Francisco that night , you 're going to be <unk> as the patient .
`` You know I had to solve ! ''
Now , here , Kevin is a parent , and a little bit of society .
And it 's going to talk about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will be able to come back .
Oil is not just something I 've found in the work .
It 's personal .
My grandfather 's <unk> .
That act , despite the end of their own pain , I gave me the opportunity to do .
This is what happens .
Now , for most <unk> people , or those who think of the boat , you do n't think about the <unk> to another person .
I just want to want you to their own pain .
On the general , this is only about three ways : sleep , drugs or the death or death .
In my career , I 've got to show it , and I 've been involved in hundreds of mental disease and calls from the bridge .
Now , of those <unk> in which I 've been available in , I just have lost two , but those two are too much .
One was spiders .
The other was a man when I talked about about a hour .
For that time , I got the hand in three times .
In the end , I looked at , and he said , `` Kevin , I 'm sorry , but I have to go . ''
And they were .
It 's absolutely crazy .
I want to tell you , yet , that the great majority of the people that we 've got to participate in that bridge not .
Now , that , those few who have come from the bridge and lived , and you can talk about it , that one percent or two percent , most of those people have said that the second that they had made a mistake and wanted to live .
I tell people , the bridge is not only <unk> with San Francisco , but also people .
That connection , or bridge we do , it 's something that all of us and each of us need to be able to do .
Oil can prevent it .
There 's help . There 's hope .
Thank you very much .
The world makes you what you 're not , but in your way you know what you 're , and a question you know what you are , and how do you do it .
I should be a single thing in that sense , but I 'm not used , I 'm not used .
When I was in a model I was born , I was taken the dream that had had a few child .
My outside finally <unk> with my truth , with my me .
Now , by hard reasons , that I 'm going to go back later , when I look at this picture , I 'm going to look at this picture , you 'll get it out .
But the October past , I found that , just , I 'm just starting .
Now , we know our families , our religion , our society , our society , even our bodies .
Some of them have the value value , to come from the <unk> of the skin of the skin or by the beliefs of people who will get us .
They are people who always lose the <unk> , which is that it 's considered .
In my case , the last nine years ago , many of my neighbors , many of my friends , a lot of my friends , my diet even .
I think this is called Mary .
This is my God .
I 'll be known as `` child . ''
I remember my five years in the United States , in my house , I always had to put this quote in the head .
And my mom told me , `` Why do n't you get that sign in the head ? ''
I said , `` Mom , is my hair . I 'm a girl . ''
I knew then the <unk> .
The gender has always considered a fact , but now we now know that , actually , it 's something more complex and such .
Because of my success , I never got to share my story , not because I thought to be what I 'm a bad thing , but why the world is about those of us who want to help me .
All of the days I 'm very woman .
I have mom , dad and a family who showed me as I 'm .
Many are not so lucky .
There 's a long tradition in the local culture that suggests the mystery of gender .
There 's a <unk> of compassion .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> .
And when I was eight years ago , I was in a party in the United States who took these behavior .
I was sitting in the stage , and I remember that this beautiful woman looked at me , and I remember that moment as I 'm something <unk> : This is the kind of woman I wanted to be .
And when I was 15 years ago , when I still had a man called <unk> .
It 's the <unk> of a <unk> .
That night she told me , `` Why do you do you do you do in the beauty of beauty ? ''
He told me that if you were able to be able to be able to be able to go out of the top of Caltech , and that night , and that night , and that night , I looked at me , and that night , I looked at me from the bathroom , he looked at me on me .
That moment changed my life .
Suddenly , I was in the world of the <unk> of beauty .
There 's no lot of people can say that his first work was from queen of women , but I know .
I also met the <unk> of the <unk> , about everything when we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
But more important than everything , I met my best friends from that community .
In 2001 , my mom , I had to move to San Francisco , I called me and I told me that I 'm going to come to me , I was going to go to live in the U.S. .
I know it .
I said to my mother , `` Hey , I 'm sorry .
I 'm here with friends , I like to travel and be a magic of beauty . ''
But then , two weeks later , I called and said , `` You know that if you get you to the United States , you can change the name and your identity identity ? ''
It was everything I needed to hear .
My mom told me that I took two , and my name .
She also was also surprised when I got it in Cambridge to the 19 years .
It 's a funny that in some of the most rural cities in order to make the most <unk> and <unk> and sustainable .
In that then in the U.S. , it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender .
So in 2001 , in 2001 I went to San Francisco , and I remember to look at the <unk> <unk> with the name of <unk> and the <unk> .
It was a great moment .
To some people , their <unk> , it means power to drive or they can be able to get a <unk> , but for me , it was the <unk> to live , to feel .
Suddenly , my fears you saw <unk> .
I felt that I could take my dream and let me go to New York , and it will be model .
Many are not so lucky .
I think in this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A young woman in New York who took a truth , but that , <unk> , put their life .
To a lot of my community , that 's the reality that live .
Our production rate are eight times more than the rest of the population of the population .
And all the 20 of China we do a global <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
I 'm in this stage , thanks to a long story of people who would get up and put back to the alphabet .
These are , they 're wearing Johnson , and it 's a <unk> .
Today , in this same time , I 'm going to go back from the finger .
I ca n't continue to live , and just for me .
I want to do the best to help the others to live their truth without shame , not fear .
I 'm here , <unk> , for that one day , there 's no more <unk> <unk> .
My biggest truth led me to accept what I 'm .
Do you do you ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , it 's a quick question .
<unk> <unk> : Of course . You see with all my job .
To my own network , to my parents , to my family , which is very strong .
I remember all of the times that I 've got to go to women young women , which I 've seen , and some of them , when I said , when I said that their parents could n't tell me , I took the phone , called my mom and said , `` Hey , you can call this woman ? ''
Sometimes it worked , other , not . It 's not what it 's in the center of what we are , right ?
It 's going to say , all of us , you 've got a gender , and what I 'm trying to do it is to put on the table the topic that I 'm trying to do it , and that should have a space that would be able to get to the <unk> people . And this is a conversation that we should have with parents .
The movement movement is <unk> with the gay movement .
There 's still amazing work for doing .
I should be understanding .
I should have space for curiosity and to do questions , and I hope you all of you .
KS : Thank you .
In a lot of societies , and the parents , the parents do n't know by their children , but I 'm one of the few parents who said by his daughter and I 'm proud of it .
And it started his campaign for education prevent their rights in 2007 , and when you get their efforts in 2011 , and when you get the efforts in 2011 , the British National Prize of peace , it was very famous , a very famous girl in his country .
Before that , it was my daughter , but I 'm now a parent .
Ladies and gentlemen , if you get a look at the story of humanity , the story of women is the story of the alphabet , of the inequality , of violence , of violence , of violence .
You 'll see , in the societies , just from the beginning , just from the beginning , when you get a child , their birth does n't know .
No , it 's not , not for his father , not by his mother .
The neighborhood comes up , day their <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father .
And a mother is a lot of a little girl .
When you get light to the first girl , the first daughter , it becomes sad .
When you get to light to the second daughter , it 's <unk> , and , with the hope of a son , when I was a third daughter , it feels like a system .
It 's not only the mother , but the daughter . The daughter is going to come up , when it moves , it 's also .
At the age of five years , when I should go to school , it 's gone in home and school to their brothers .
At the age of 12 years ago , it has a good life .
You can do it .
You can play with their friends in the street , and it can move by the streets as a time .
But when you go on the adolescence , when it was 13 years ago , they brought it out of his house without a sound .
It 's taken to the four walls of their house .
It 's not a free person .
It becomes the called honor from his father and their brothers and their family and their family , and if you get the code of that , honor , could not fight .
And it 's interesting that this code code , not only the life of a girl , which is also the life of the family members of the family .
So , this brother , <unk> the <unk> of their life and happiness from their sisters in the name of course honor .
And there 's a more more than the most companies that 's called cosmology .
It 's supposed to be a good girl that has a very bit of a lot , very simple and very <unk> .
It 's the <unk> .
The model of a good girl should be <unk> .
It 's supposed to be a <unk> , and you know the decisions of his father and their mother and the decisions of the village , even if you do n't want .
If you show them with a man that do n't like or if you were the <unk> with a old man , has to realize , because it does n't want to be able to be <unk> .
If it 's very young , has to realize .
On the opposite , the <unk> <unk> .
And what happens to the end ?
In words of a <unk> : `` The <unk> , the <unk> , and then it gives light to more children and daughters . ''
And the <unk> of the situation is that this mother , <unk> the same lesson of it to his daughter and the same lesson of honor their children .
And this circle that 's going on , and it turns out .
<unk> brothers and sisters , when he was born <unk> , and for the first time , I think , I do n't like the fact , I 'm going to be honest , but when I was there and looked at their eyes , I believe , I was believe .
And so long before I was born , I thought in his name , and I was born with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan .
His name was <unk> <unk> , and I called my daughter , so for it .
But when I looked at , they were all men , and I took my wife , and I 'll get a line of my name , and I wrote , `` <unk> . ''
And when she grew up , when I had four years and a half years ago , the <unk> in my school .
Do you mean , why should I mention a little girl in a school ?
Yes , I need to stop .
You can give you in Canada , in the United States , in many countries , but in many countries , but in the poor countries , in traditional societies , it 's a great event for life .
<unk> in a school means of their identity and their name .
One of the school means that it has come on in the world of dreams , and the complex where it can explore their potential for their future life .
I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and I would be able to go to school , and I would be a few weeks earlier , when you get the way of the seventh line , I could n't remember the members of some of my sisters .
And the reason I 've never seen the names of my sisters writing in no computer .
That was the reason that value to my daughter .
What my father could n't give my sisters or their daughters , I thought I had to change .
I used the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter .
The <unk> to put me with me when my friends came to me .
The ones going to go with different meetings .
And all of these values , I 've been trying to put it in their personality .
And this was not just for her , just to <unk> .
I 've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys as well .
He used the education for the shadows .
I brought to my daughters , he taught the students , to forget the lesson of it .
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the <unk> called <unk> .
And the Wright brothers and sisters , the most rights for women , and they were able to have more and more space for women in society .
But we found with a new phenomenon .
It was deadly for human rights , and in particular , for the rights of women .
It 's called <unk> .
That means a whole <unk> of women in all the political activities , economic and social systems .
Some of schools lost .
The girls are going to go to school .
The women are going to use it up and then go to the markets .
The musicians came up , the girls <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> billion , but it was exciting , and it was exciting to have all of those people who were sick and <unk> when you talk about their rights .
It 's really terrible .
On the 10 years , you 'll get it up and put it by the right to education .
He wrote a day for the queen of the BBC , he gave her her for the National City Times , and I talked about every platform that could .
And their voice was the most powerful voice .
It 's <unk> as a <unk> in the world .
And that was the reason that the Taliban could n't lose their campaign , and the nine of the October of the 2012 , he turned to <unk> in the head .
It was a <unk> day for my family and for me .
The world became a large black hole .
While my daughter was <unk> between life , and the death , I 'll get back to my wife to my wife , `` I want to say why he happened to my daughter , your daughter ? ''
And they said , `` Please , you do n't give you .
<unk> the cause .
<unk> your life in the cause of the truth , by the cause of peace , and by the cause of education , and your daughter was inspired in you , and you get it .
They were in the right road and God protect them . ''
These few words would have a lot of me to me , and I did n't come back to talk about again .
When I was in the hospital , and I had a material , and it was very strong , and it 's very strong , and it 's very strong <unk> , because it 's a <unk> , I used to see a shadow of the face of my wife .
But my daughter would never know .
I used to tell you , `` I 'm well with my smile , and with the <unk> in my face .
I 'll give you good . Please do n't worry . ''
And it was one of us for us , and we 'll get us .
And the Wright brothers and sisters , we 've learned from her how much more hard , and I 'm trying to share with you , that despite you to be a signal for the children of children and women , it 's like any girl .
He was not going to get it on .
They fight with their brothers , and I 'm very happy for that .
People told me , `` What 's a special in my uncle who has done so close to <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> ? ''
I say , I do n't ask you what I did .
<unk> what I did n't .
I do n't get their water and that 's everything .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
I went out of the brain , 18 years ago , and from that day , the science of the brain has been done in a personal passion .
I am engineering .
And I want to tell you to tell you , I 've got to tell you , I 've got a group of <unk> , where I 've had a <unk> to my chest , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the work of the <unk> that I 'm talking about today here is about the brain of the brain , I did it before you do today .
He said this , there 's a man when you get it into a matter of brain .
You 're going to be a kind of smart or not ?
You do n't be like , you can go back to be smart ?
And then , of course , I 'll become a part of the brain , and I had to live with it .
It was not the gray matter , but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk> .
I had to decide after the bee , I had to ask what many to take , more than a dozen of a dozen different discoveries every day , you know , if I did n't get it out of anything .
Every day , during the last 18 years , I 've had to decide about the open and tens of chemicals , and try to do with life .
And so I 've got a little bit .
But , for short , I have a soul of <unk> , why I decided to try to try to get the <unk> of the <unk> , because there 's not not there a map of clear that you say in <unk> .
I started to prove with different of different , and I was starting to see how a little changes in the 1930s , my <unk> , my sense of who was me , my sense of who was me , my behavior with others .
A very amazing case : during a few months , I was trying to lose doses and chemical chemicals for a <unk> man , and I was surprised to see how to see the thoughts .
I was always wondering , I thought all of the time in sex , and I thought that was the most smart person from all the world , and -- of course , so many times in the past I 've heard a few guys like this , or maybe a few versions .
It turns out like a point .
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be a bit .
In fact , I was trying to be , a way , to fix a problem that was in front , and just do n't happen this .
So I could n't get it .
I changed my doses .
But I think that that experience gave me a new definition of men , and about what they have to go back . And so I 'm going to go back with the men .
And what I 'm trying to do . And I looked at these hormones and Rose and others and others , I was able to get my intelligence after the disease and the operation , my thinking , my thinking .
And I 'm going to think about images , and that became my point of key , and how to do those images that will be able to create <unk> , my ideas , if you want to create <unk> , my ideas , if you want ?
This kind of thoughts is not new .
We 'll be able to be able to take it , and you 've got to see the things in a similar way .
They had the images and the mental ideas were the same thing .
Today , there are people who do this idea , and there are a lot of things about how it works .
So , after a few years ago , I 'll find the point right , and I 've got a lot of big <unk> <unk> , really <unk> , well , well , well , and well .
Now , I 'm working in how to give you good these mental images , of my mind to the screen of the computer .
You imagine what if a director of film would be able to use their imagination to be able to make their imagination in the world who has in front ?
Or if a musician could take the music of their head ?
There 's amazing possibilities with this , as the way that people can get to share the speed of light .
And the truth is that , the only difficulty is that , the only difficulty to do this is just to increase the understanding of our brain systems .
Let me show you why I think we 're pretty close to come to this with two experiments in the recent experiments we 've done by two different experiments .
We were able to have a biological technology , image for <unk> <unk> , to create the brain . Here you can see the brain , made by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues .
The floor of the left shows the <unk> of the brain of a person that look at a picture .
The <unk> floor shows the <unk> of the brain of the same individual as you see , seeing that same picture .
The floor of the right , I was created the content of the central floor of the left of the left of the left .
This is a lot of different individuals with a lot of different images , always with a result .
The difference between see a image and imagine to see that same picture is almost a bit .
Now , let me share another experiment . This is the laboratory lab in Berkeley , California .
They were able to get the brain waves in mental fields .
It 's going on this way .
In this experiment , I showed people hundreds of hours of hours from the YouTube , as you get their brains to create a great set of reactions to create a big band of the brain in the video .
And then , I showed you a film with images , and people , new animals , and as so much it would be able to get it a new dimension .
The computer , using the brain 's brain 's brain <unk> to show you what the person was seeing .
On the right , you can see the <unk> of the computer , and at the left , the video that showed you .
This is going to go up .
We 're going to do it .
We just need to improve the feeling .
And now , remember that when you look at a picture , and when you see that the same image , you think in the brain 's brain .
This is led to place with the systems of the biggest brain of the biggest brain today today , and they get it up as a thousand times in the last years .
We now need to create the sense of a thousand times more to get a more deep .
How do we do it ?
There are a lot of techniques to do it .
One is to open the skull and to take electrodes .
I do n't teach me for that .
Many of them are built new techniques from a projection for images , even me .
The key wisdom says that the only way to get closer to get the biggest way to get closer , but to this point , most of the most <unk> , the more <unk> , they do n't use by thousands as we need .
I 'm going to take this idea : instead of the most big end , we 're going to make the world .
We can create structures structures with different , like making a <unk> .
And why does this matter ?
In the last few years , a big amount of effort in which were going to do really big , right ?
But yet , most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> solutions and brilliant and <unk> , in the ears , and it 's going to make it from radio radio radio in the biological systems .
On a time , in time from a field field , and there are these black patterns on the <unk> of radio body .
So , in the <unk> patterns with the patterns of the <unk> of radio radio <unk> , we can create a different way of the information that you can take it in a place .
We can see , we can be able to be able to split our social knowledge on the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need .
And when you use the barriers we should be able to be able to measure , not only the <unk> of blood <unk> , but the <unk> and <unk> that I saw , and maybe even the giant activity .
We can be able to tell you our ideas in the digital media .
You know , if we could go through the language , and we work directly through thinking ?
What would we be able to do ?
And how do you try to deal with the sense of human thinking without practice ?
You thought the Internet is a big thing .
These are big questions .
It would be an tool as a tool to explain our skills of thinking and communication .
Now , here , this same tool could take the cure of violence and diseases .
We have a few choices more than open this door .
Now , in all ways , you give you a year , happen in five or 15 years ?
It 's hard to imagine it 's much more .
We have to learn how to give this step together .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about this night , and not in a modern sense , not just the gay sense , not just the gay .
I think we know we all have done .
Their clothes may be saying to some person for the first time that the love or tell someone who 's asked , or I tell somebody who has cancer , or any other conversation that you 've got to get it in life .
All it 's a hard conversation , and if our issues can be built , the experience of <unk> , and have come from that finger is something universal .
It 's afraid , and we do n't like to happen .
A lot of years ago , I was born in the South <unk> <unk> <unk> , a restaurant in the city , and there was there , I had to go back to see some of a number of <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> : I do n't know , `` Do n't tell me , I 'm going to say , `` Do n't tell my
And I 'll be known that for the <unk> of my short , and so I 've got the head made a little kid , I asked me a little child , I asked me a little child , `` Hey , you 're a guy or girl ? ''
And it 's a perfect silence in the table .
I 'll get a little bit more , I would give me my shoulder with a <unk> .
The father <unk> the paper , and the mother would have a cold to get their son .
But I do n't say anything , and it 's <unk> by inside .
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years ago , I was list to fight .
And that 's a terrible feeling .
So I realized that the next time would say something .
I put that conversation .
So after a few weeks ago , happened again .
`` You 're a guy or a girl ? ''
A lot of familiar , but I was going to come back , and I was going to come back and I was going to come back to come back to come back to come back to come on the <unk> things in the table .
<unk> .
And even one of the <unk> of the vagina , '' which I thought .
So let 's go back and I looked at the end , and I looked at my back and my next girl , with a <unk> girl with a <unk> , where it 's not a challenge for a page , just a girl with a question , `` You 're a girl or a girl ? ''
So let 's go back again , I put it back back from it , and I said , `` Hey , I know that this is something .
I have the short hair as the one of a kid , and I 've seen clothes of a kid , but I 'm a girl , and you know , like you know , so as you 're going to use a <unk> , and sometimes you like to use a comfortable smile .
And so , I 'm more from the kind of girl from a comfortable tissues . ''
And that girl looked at me , please attention , and he said , `` My favorite mom is , and it has a fish .
You can give you a <unk> , please ? ''
And that was everything . It 's just a girl .
What about the <unk> I asked ? ''
It was the most easy conversation that I 've never had to have .
And why ? And why was the child from the <unk> and me , both , we went to the one with the other .
So , as many of us , I 've lived in some of us in my life , and I know , often , my walls used to be a hammer .
But in the dark , you ca n't know about what color are the walls .
You can only know how a really feels living in a soul .
It 's like , like my neck is not different than you , or in you , or to you .
You know , I 'll give you 100 reasons from the why I come from my finger was more difficult to come out from the back , but this is the issue : it 's not .
The hard thing is hard .
Who can tell me that I explain to somebody who have taken up in the meantime , it 's more hard to tell you that has been Alaska ?
Who can tell me that this story that I 'm more hard to tell your son of five years that you 're going to happen ?
There 's no more hard thing , there 's only hard .
We need to stop what it 's hard to about what hard to other person to make us feel better or worse , or we should only feel empathy because we 've just feel empathy because we all live something hard .
In some point in our lives , we 've all live on , and you can make you feel security , or at least more security than the other side of the door .
But I 'm here to tell you . They do n't matter about what they 're made their walls , a magic is not a place to live .
Thank you . Let 's read it in 20 years ago .
I was , I had a tail of horse , a <unk> and shoes .
It was not the <unk> , it 's not to fight them against any child from four years to go to the coffee .
I was sitting by the fear , <unk> in a corner of my own dark , and the move only a muscle is the more likely that never ever done .
My family , my friends , a little bit with the time that I 've spent my entire life trying to be able to do , and now the world would get back to purpose .
I was taken the pages of a village that we 've all made for so long , but if you do n't take that smile , they would kill them .
A one of my <unk> <unk> was in the wedding of my sister .
And it was the first time that many of the Reagan knew that it was gay , and when I 'm going to do my <unk> , and when I 'm going to do my <unk> from honor to honor , in my black black and comet . I went back to one where were the friends of my parents .
And after I 'll talk about a moment , one of the women said , `` I love it ! ''
And the battle of the gay story had started .
`` You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , `` You know , you know , `` <unk> . ''
`` Well , I know , the truth is we have friends in San Francisco . ''
`` Well , we 've never gone there , but we 've heard it 's fun . ''
`` <unk> , you know my <unk> <unk> ?
It 's very good , and you 've never talked about to have . ''
`` <unk> , what is your favorite program ?
Our favorite program ?
And you know who I love ?
Man is our favorite . ''
And then a woman , it 's , but I 'll wait to show it a support , to give you to know that I was from my own market , then he said , `` Well , sometimes my husband uses a leap . ''
And I had a chance in that moment , as you have all the advent of <unk> .
You know , I could have been easy to say where it was <unk> .
It 's not very hard to find and realize the fact that they were <unk> .
And what another thing you can ask somebody , but they do n't do ?
If you 're going to be clear with somebody , you have to be prepared to be prepared for what you get .
It 's like that the hard conversations do n't be my own point .
Let 's tell you with anyone that I 've got .
But I 'm going to call it , and I 'm going to call the three principles of the <unk> .
Now , please see this through the gay perspective , but they understood that what 's going to come out of anything , is essentially the same thing .
Number one : listen to me .
Let 's tell you . You know you .
That girl in the coffee I did n't have to say , but I was list for the battle .
If you want you to be a lot , the other you have to know that we also have .
Number two : Thank you a lot of them . They 'll be able to get them .
If you know that they are gay , <unk> .
If you say to their parents who might be gay , they do the hope that that could change .
They do n't give you a sense of hope .
And number three , and more important .
You get their truth .
They 're going to be <unk> for that .
And some of you can get sure , <unk> by what they 've done , but you never know why they are .
And I know , maybe some of you , you know , but that 's something in them , not in you .
Those are the expectations of them about what you are , but they do n't tell you .
That 's the story of them , but not about you .
The only story that matters is that you want to write .
So , the next time you find in a dark <unk> , you have to know that we 've all been there before .
And it can be very better , but they 're not .
Thank you , thank you . They lose the Taliban .
RS , what is that ?
If you look at the story of how you 've seen intelligence , a little example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that `` The question of if a machine can think is so interesting as the question of if a metaphor can swim . ''
When <unk> <unk> wrote this was made it as a critical of the machine as three degrees .
And so , a few years ago , a program , to try to try to understand the fundamental physical technology of intelligence .
You know a step .
We actually start with a mental experiment .
Imagine that they 're from a high race , which you do n't know about the biology of the Earth , not know about the Earth 's not from the Earth , no intelligence of Earth , but they have a amazing lives and you can look at Earth , and they have incredibly successful lives , so you can look at Earth .
And you see a very strange effect .
Of course , we know that the reason would be that we 're trying to make ourselves to ourselves .
We 're trying to avoid a impact .
But if you 're from a <unk> race that does n't know about this , which does n't have no concept about intelligence from Earth , you can be able to develop a theory of physical theory that explain how to develop a theory of a physical theory that explain how to be able to develop the surface of a planet .
And that 's why I think this is the same question that we understand nature of intelligence .
So , in this program that took a few years ago , you 've got a variety of issues through science , through many of a lot , which drives , I think , to a only <unk> mechanism of intelligence .
In course , for example , there 's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be able to be connected to the development of intelligence , and , in particular , for the digital states that affect the diversity of human states .
Finally , in the beginning of movement movement , there 's been a variety of recent techniques that have trying to make the skills of robots that have trying to make the skills of robots with the end of making complex tasks .
And so , we put all these different different issues , and they put together , from a few years ago : there 's a mechanism for the intelligence that we can take all these different issues ?
Is there just a equation for intelligence ?
And I think the answer is . The thing that you 're seeing is probably the most close to a <unk> and <unk> <unk> for the intelligence that I 've seen .
So what you 're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force , <unk> , which shows it with the end of maximize the biggest freedom of action .
It 's going to take the future freedom for action , or keep the choices , with a force , with a force , with the diversity of possible future .
In a few words , the intelligence do n't like it .
The intelligence trying to take the future freedom of action and keep the choices .
And so , you have to realize this equation , it 's natural ask : What can you do with this ?
What do it mean ?
You know the human level ?
Are a artificial intelligence ?
So I 'm going to show you now a video I think , I 'll show you some of the amazing applications of this simple .
Narrator : Now , you know , <unk> research in Scotland have shown that the universes that they produce more attention , or `` gentlemen , '' during their life should have trend to the most objective conditions for us .
But what if this connection connection between politics and intelligence <unk> a larger relationship ?
What if the smart behavior is not just interacting with the production of civil entropy , but it 's going to be available through her ?
To find it , we 've developed a <unk> of software called <unk> , designed to maximize the production of civil entropy in any system in any system in any system in any system in any system in any system .
Man , <unk> could be going to spend a lot of political intelligence , play games games , and even to make money , everything that 's not going to do that .
Here are some examples of <unk> in action .
At the way that a human foot without come up , here we see it to <unk> with a <unk> to using a place using a place .
This behavior is amazing in part , because we never realized a goal .
I just decided to get it by their own balance .
This ability of balance to have applications for the loss and technologies of human beings .
This capacity of use robots have to have applications in the smart and agriculture .
Now , as some other animals can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of a wall at the same time to get the food , here we see that it can be able to make a version version of that task .
This capacity of cooperation has interesting for the economic and in a variety of other fields .
<unk> is quite measuring by a variety of efficacy .
For example , here we see it to make a game game against themselves , <unk> their potential for the game .
So here you see it to <unk> and new connections in a social network where the friends are all around and they 're born with success .
This same capacity of the network , also has applications in health care , in energy and intelligence .
So here you see it to <unk> the rise of a <unk> of <unk> , we 're able to success , and using the <unk> <unk> to be able to build the global level of the desert to the desert .
Now , in the same way , you 'll be able to ignore them to problems in sexual cars , etc. and transport .
Finally , here we see <unk> to discover and get a <unk> strategy , <unk> in a series of <unk> , we need to create the assets in their solutions .
This ability of risk of risk to have a lot of applications in pain and in sure .
<unk> <unk> : What you 've seen is that a variety of whether a variety of human behaviors as the use use of tools , walk down and social cooperation , all of a single equation , that leads to a system to maximize their own freedom freedom .
Now , here , there 's a <unk> .
Let 's go back to the beginning of the robot of the robot , the work `` <unk> , '' there was always the concept that if we use smart machines , there would have a joke .
The machines are connected to us .
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades , we 've had all the concept of the concept of 2030 .
It 's not that the individual machines are very smart , and then we 're trying to be able to be able to be able to get back to the world .
It 's all the opposite , which is the way to take control the control of all the physical future is a most fundamental principle that the intelligence , which intelligence can actually be able to be able to make control control , instead of being as well .
Another consequence of the goal of the goal .
You often ask me , `` How is that you look at goals , it 's taken from this kind of pattern ?
My equivalent of that statement to go to the continents to help them to build the artificial accidents or to help help the human intelligence , is the following : intelligence should be view as a physical process of action and prevent the American freedom .
Thank you very much .
We 're in a point of point in human history , something between the <unk> of stars and lose the planet we call `` home . ''
Although , in the last years , we 've got a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth does in the context of the universe .
And the mission of NASA has discovered thousands of new planets that extends around about other stars , which is going to be just one between the thousands of millions of planets from our galaxy .
It 's a space of space that is the fifth telescope to be able to come out of the stars when the planets go on in front of them , and it 's a little of that light that we get it .
The data made out of the possibility of the planets from the distance that there is between them and his star .
In fact , this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> as the <unk> planets of our solar system , and also the amount of light that they get out of their tissues .
So , this day , this day when these planets that we find are a lot or not .
Unfortunately , while we 're able to find this sort of <unk> , our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity .
The square year was the most <unk> year .
<unk> and ice ice who have been with us from a few years now , they 're going to make us in a question of decades .
These changes that we 've built to scale scale , they have changed rapidly the ability to protect their course .
But I 'm not a scientist of the climate , or no man .
And that we study the advent of the planet , we 've got through the stars , with the hope to find places in the universe where we found life beyond our planet .
You could say , I 'll say , I 'll look at opportunities on the economic sector .
Now , as a very interested , as a very interested in the amount of life in the universe I can tell you that the most planets look like the Earth , most of our own planet .
Every one of these new worlds that allows a comparison between the planet we 've been discovered and the planets that we know better : our solar system .
Let 's take our neighbor , Mars .
Mars is a little and <unk> , and even even to be a little bit more far from the Sun , it can be able to be able to be able to be shown this by a mission as a mission .
In fact , it 's possible that Mars is possible in the past , and in part , is why we study so much about Mars .
Our <unk> as the <unk> , '' his surface , in order to celebrate the proportion of life , and as we know it .
The materials that we built it , as the mission of the <unk> mission , and they 're going to take a samples of the atmosphere , and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their amygdala .
Public companies now are not just a lot of space , but also the possibility to live in Mars .
But even even these images <unk> us to the income of our planet , places that they 're able to be able to do in our imagination with the <unk> and <unk> , in terms of the Earth with the <unk> and <unk> .
Let 's take the wall of the <unk> areas of our planet that still have to be able to paint , places actually <unk> in comparison with Mars .
Even in the most expensive places , and more than the Earth and more than the Earth is new , and they 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get back to the forests of a distance .
I know , I know that this thing is by the <unk> of Mars and other planets to try to get a big and sad shadow , the formula and the belief of some of some that Mars will expect there to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of the single planet that we know that it 's really easily .
So , so I 'm a lot that I 'm like this <unk> exploration , I 'm in very deep , and I 'm in a very deep thing .
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars , but say that Mars will be there to be out of the understanding of humanity , is like imagine that the captain of the fact , we know , which is how to imagine that the captain of the fact we 'll have to be place later .
But the goals for space exploration , and the Earth does n't get up .
It 's not , in fact , they 're actually faces from the same coin : the goal of understanding , preserve and improve life in the future .
The international environments in our world as a <unk> <unk> .
They just find more about home .
If we can understand how to create and keep there , and they keep space spaces , in the edge of the body , and we may be able to cover the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that .
I 'm going to leave you with a mental experiment , the paradox .
A lot of years ago , the physical Hills said : I had to realize that our universe has been around from a long time , and we hope that there 's a lot of planets in this universe , we should have found evidence of our life life .
Well , where are you ?
Well , a possible to the paradox to the paradox is that when we get them to get the hard enough enough to be able to be living with the stars , they lose the notion of the important thing that is protect the challenges of planets who are able to protect this development .
It 's a lot of thinking that just to be able to be able to save ourselves from ourselves , but we 'll take it up and space exploration can work together .
If we actually think about our ability to be able to the sustainable brain of Mars for the human presence , then we should be able to make the task more easy to preserve the Earth .
Thank you .
A few years ago , <unk> my own house .
And while I was in the front of looking at my pockets , I realized that I did n't have play .
In fact , I could see by the window who were in the table who were in the table , where I had left .
So , fast decided to open all the other doors and windows , and they were all good .
I thought , I 'm going to call a <unk> , at least I had my cell , but to put them , a <unk> could be able to get a long time to get , and he would go cold .
I could n't go back to home from my friend 's friend to spend night , because I had a 20 percent in Europe to the next morning , and I 'll get up from my passport and my boss .
It 's a expensive , but sure that you do n't more expensive than a half of the night , so I thought , that despite the circumstances , there 's well .
I 'm a little bit of paper , and I know a little bit about how the brain works .
It turns out of you that moves up the heart rate , <unk> the parking levels and <unk> the thinking .
And when I got to put to the top of the airport , I realized that I did n't have my passport .
Well , I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep .
And I started wondering , if there was something that I could do , systems that could do , systems that could put in their place , which would be able to put it wrong things .
Or at least , if you 're going to do bad things , which is the probability of the probability that is a total of a total .
So I started thinking about that , but until a month after my thoughts do n't <unk> .
I was writing with my colleague <unk> <unk> , three of the Nobel Prize , and a little worried I talked about that I was the window , and then I had to explain my passport , and then I had to talk about me that I had been wondering something called <unk> .
And it 's something that he had learned from the <unk> <unk> , who were written from this one few years earlier , known as the <unk> .
They all know what 's the <unk> .
Every time , there 's a disaster , a team team is , and it 's about to figure out what he came wrong , yes ?
In the <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , you can try and try to figure all the things that they could go wrong , as well , trying to figure out what can do to prevent things that are going to do to prevent things .
So what I want to talk to you with you , is some things we can do in the way of a <unk> .
Some of them are obsolete , other are not so nervous .
I 'm going to start with the obvious .
In the house , <unk> a place for the things that you lose .
This sounds of common sense , and it 's , but there 's a lot of science that put this thesis , and then it works in how our memory 's memory .
There 's a structure in the brain called hippocampus , which has evolved over thousands of years , to make a <unk> of the most important things , where it 's the fish , which is the fish , which is the fish , which is the fish , which is the fish , which is the fish , which is the fish , which is the fish , which
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that 's <unk> in the middle of London .
It 's the part of the brain that allows you to find their child .
And if you ask if someone actually made the experiment , you get the sense of <unk> , and even so they could find their child .
They do n't use the approach , but the hippocampus , that built very evolved of the brain to find things .
But it 's really good for things that they do n't get a lot , not so good for things that they move a lot .
This is the reason that 's the reason to lose a lot of the car , 5,000 to school .
So in home <unk> a place for the day , a walk back to the door , maybe a little plate .
To their passport , a particular flower .
And for their limitations of reading , a particular guy .
If you look at a place , and they are <unk> with it , and they 're <unk> with it , you always 'll be there when you look .
What happens with the letter ?
Let 's go with the cell , a picture of their credit card , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for the cloud .
If you get these things , or the <unk> , this can determine the Himalayas .
These are some of the most obvious things .
Remember , when you 're low stress , the brain focuses up .
He 's a little and <unk> thinking .
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress , we do n't be in the best moment , and there are that we put the systems in their website .
And there 's perhaps not more interesting situation that when you get it into a medical decision .
And in some time , we all will be in that situation , we have to take a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or the one will be happy , to help them with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
And I talk about a very particular , very particular .
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of decisions , and in fact , for the fact of the local decisions and social decisions , any kind of decision that there is to take that that 's going to be able to take out of the one of the facts .
So let 's tell you the doctor and the doctor says , `` I 've got the result of the lab , and it 's a little high . ''
They all know that the high distance becomes a greater risk risk , attack the heart , the brain .
So you 're thinking that I 've got to be the best disaster is not the best , then the doctor says , `` I 'd like to give you a drug that helps you reduce the curiosity , a <unk> . ''
And maybe you 've heard about the Himalayas , and knows that it 's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today , even you 're even likely to tell people who do .
So you think , `` Yes , <unk> <unk> ! ''
But there 's a question that you have to do then , a statistic that is to ask that most of the doctors do n't want to talk about , and companies even less .
It 's for the <unk> , the number we need to try .
And what is this , the <unk> ?
It 's the number of people who have to take a drug , or we put them to a surgery in any doctor in any doctor before they help help a person .
And it needs to think about what kind of <unk> statistic is that ?
The number is to be one .
My doctor do n't tell me something if it 's not to help me .
But , in reality , human practice does n't work .
And it 's not , it 's not , the doctor , and if it 's funny from somebody , is from scientists like me .
We do n't know it very good the mechanisms .
But the <unk> <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 percent of people .
So the number we need to treat the more effective <unk> , what do you think it is ?
How many people have to give you before a person ?
300 .
This is in the research research in the research of researchers to be able to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> .
I 'm going to take the numbers .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before to avoid a single heart attack , the brain or another event .
Now , maybe you think , `` Well , one of a probability in 300 of the walk on my pants .
Why do n't , `` How do n't , doctor ?
But then you 've got to ask by a bit more , and it 's , `` The <unk> effects . '' Yes ?
To this drug in particular , the future effects are produced in five percent of the patients .
And those and those look like , and it 's a <unk> pain , and it 's able to get , pain , pain , but now you think , `` five percent is not very likely to be going to me , even so we take medicine . ''
But a moment .
remember , in stress , you do n't think about it .
So you think about how to do this with the time , so you do n't have to make the amount of focus in the act .
300 people take the drug , not ? One person has helped , five percent of the 300 people have effects , that 's 15 people .
You have 15 times more likely to come up by the ability to give you the drug .
I do n't tell you , or not take the <unk> .
I just say you should have this conversation with your doctor .
Now , the medical wisdom is to be , it 's part of the beginning of <unk> consent .
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not .
Maybe you 're thinking that I 've launched this number in the air by the value of the road , but actually this number we need to treat it .
To the surgery that you 've done in the biggest men of 50 , <unk> in cancer , the number we need to try it is .
So it 's , let 's go up with a person for a person who has helped .
And the effects effects in that case , they produce 50 percent of the patients .
Now , these can be able to go up , or we 'll use it up , I 'm looking at it .
And if you have a lucky , and it 's one of that 50 percent the effects would only have a year or two .
So the idea of the <unk> is to think about time from time , you can think about the conversation that you can tell you the conversation back .
You do n't have why we do all about this in the act .
And they also want to think about the quality of life .
Because you 've got a choice many times , you want a lot of a lot of pain , or a more long life that could have a lot of pain in the end ?
These are the things that talk about and think about now , with his family and their loved ones .
They can change in the power of the moment , but at least that you 're trained in this kind of thinking .
You remember , our brain comes out of stress in stress , and one of the things that happens in that moment is that you get a lot of systems .
There 's a bad reason for this .
Let 's put up with a <unk> , it 's not necessary the system , or the <unk> or the system or the <unk> system , because if the body is spending , because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes up by the window for those moments of stress , is the remarkable thought , like <unk> <unk> and their colleagues have shown .
So we have to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations .
I think what 's important here is to recognize that we all are experiments .
We 're all going to go back in when .
And the idea is to think about the future how you could be from those <unk> , to put the systems in the place that they 'll get to minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things on the first place .
<unk> to the night night in 2005 , when I came out of my journey , my mom would get me a <unk> of combination on the door , with a key of the door in the same , a easy way to remember .
And I have to argue that I still have a lot of letters that I do n't know , and lots of messages that I do n't read .
So I 'm not very organized , but I see the organization as a <unk> process , and I 'm doing it .
Thank you very much .
CO : <unk> , `` Wow , '' is my favorite symbol .
It needs to play .
If you 're playing a musical instrument , and you see a <unk> , you need to play more overweight .
Two .
Four .
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree , there 's there that does n't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> .
That 's my important definition of silence : a very dark sound .
I 'd like to share a little about the story of the American system of signs , the <unk> , besides a little of my own story .
The <unk> language came up for the 1970s , and with the step of time , they get up with signs , and we found the language that we know as <unk> .
So , it has a story of about 200 years .
I was born , and I taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life .
And I thought it was true .
And yet , I 'm not to realize that it 's not true for nothing .
The sounds are a very important part of my life , actually are in my mind every day .
As a person who live in a sounds of sounds , it 's like if I grew up in a <unk> country , and then they put their rules , we do n't know their rules , we do n't .
So how do I understand the sound ?
Well , I can see how people are going to do and listen to the sound .
People are like my appearance and the sound .
You know , and <unk> that behavior .
At the same time , I learned that I can create sounds , and I 've seen how people say .
So I 've learned , for example .
`` No the door ! ''
`` You do n't make a lot of noise to the <unk> of clothes ! ''
`` No <unk> , and when you 're eating , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , `` No . ''
Now , all of this is called `` <unk> of sound . ''
Maybe I think about the most sound of sound of what the average person does .
I 'm a lot of the sounds .
And I 'm always waiting with the sound of the sound , where it 's going to come back to come back .
And there , this drawing .
<unk> , please .
<unk> , I 'll continue .
<unk> , please .
You can see that the <unk> does n't have notes in the lines .
That 's because of the lines , you 've got sounds through the <unk> and <unk> .
In the culture , the movement is equivalent to the sound .
This is the signal for `` <unk> . ''
A typical <unk> has five lines .
Yet , for me , to me , to do it with me , it does n't feel natural .
It 's why in my drawings only have four lines in paper .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to war , Germany , for a robot that 's going on .
Before this time , there were worked like <unk> .
For this summer , I came into the summer , and there are different spaces , and while I was a place in a place to another , I realized that there was not art .
In that moment , the sound was the trend , and that 's the trend .
There was no visual art , it was all .
Now the sound has gone in my art territory .
Is it to make it more art ?
I realized that it does n't have to be why .
Actually , I know the sound .
I know so well , it 's not just taken through the ears .
And I can feel about a sustainable way , or it needs to be , or even as a idea .
So I decided to draw the <unk> of sound and <unk> in my art practice .
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound , I decided to put them and <unk> .
I started to create a new body body .
And when I looked to the art community , I was born with the amount of support and attention to the amount of support .
And I realized that the sound is like the money , the power , control , change .
In the bottom of my mind , I always felt that the sound was born , it was something of one person .
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to get me to me and my art work , or I could give you .
I wish it .
There 's a different culture in the limits of language .
And just because I do n't use my <unk> voice to communicate , to the eyes of society is like if I did n't have a voice in all .
So I have to work with people who can be able to support in the way , and to get in my voice .
So that way I 'm able to be relevant in human society .
So in school , in the work and the institutions , work with a lot of different different types of <unk> .
And his voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me to be known .
And their voices have value and weight .
They 're going to ask the voices , I 'm able to get their voices , I 'm able to keep a kind of value of value something like to take a school in a very high rate .
If you do n't even do with this practice , I feel that I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have any kind of social value .
So , with the sound as my new <unk> , <unk> in the world of music .
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk> .
For example , a musical note is not able to be able to understand and express the paper .
And the same can say about a concept in <unk> .
The two are very efficient , and a lot of <unk> what it means that that changes needs to affect everything as much of the information as well .
I 'd like to share a metaphor of the piano , so they understand better how it works .
So imagine a piano .
The <unk> becomes a lot of different services .
If you take a different way for each finger as you get the piano , like the expression of the body , the speed of the body , the road , the way of the hand , the road , the way of the hand and so , while you get the piano .
But yet , the <unk> is more like a organism , you have the 10 fingers of the way to express a concept , or the idea in <unk> .
If you just be able to change the organism , they would create a completely different meaning .
The same thing is with the music in the <unk> , but the volume .
In <unk> , to use these different services , you can make different ideas .
For example , the signal `` <unk> in that . ''
This is the signal `` <unk> in that . ''
I 'm seeing .
<unk> .
Oh , I was <unk> .
TR Oh .
What are you looking at ?
Ah , good !
So I put to think , and if I see the <unk> through the music of music ?
If I had to create a sign and the <unk> and again , could be going to be like a piece of visual music .
For example , this is the sign of `` day , the sun comes up and it becomes .
This is `` everything . ''
If you <unk> it and <unk> the speed , you know , as a musical piece .
Everything .
I feel that the same can say about `` All night . ''
`` All night . ''
This is all the night , in this drawing .
And this led me to think about about three different types of night , `` Oh , '' at the night , '' at the night . ''
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two .
This represents how you call the time in <unk> and how the distance can express the changes in time .
For example , one <unk> . It 's a hand , two <unk> . It 's two hands , the present is more close and in front of the body , the future is in front of the body and the past is in the back .
So , the first example is a long time . ''
Then , `` <unk> . ''
`` Well , the common '' is a musical term with a typical rate of four times .
And yet , when I see the word `` long time , '' I think about `` time . ''
See <unk> : hand , `` hand , hand .
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest .
Man : You know , <unk> , <unk> ] [ [ <unk> .
Can you do with me ?
They all about the hands in high .
Now , we 're going to do it in the head as the chest , something like `` long time '' or `` The time . ''
Yes , very well .
That means `` <unk> '' in the international system .
The international system , as a note , it 's a visual tool to help communicate in all of the cultures and the languages cells in all the world .
The second I 'd like to show you is this . Please do me with me again .
And now this .
It means `` <unk> . ''
Now , the third . Please go again .
And again .
It 's `` ceiling . ''
Let 's do three together .
`` <unk> , '' '' and `` muscles . ''
Let you work all .
You see how three signs are very similar , all of the head and the chest , but it 's a very different thing .
It 's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and <unk> , like music .
Now , today , today , we live in a very <unk> world .
And just because the <unk> does n't have sounds , it 's not a social value .
We have to start to ask to question what the social value and allow it to the <unk> of their own value , no sounds .
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society .
And maybe people understand that you do n't have to be deaf to learn <unk> . You do n't have to learn with music .
The <unk> is a <unk> , and I would like to have the same experience .
I would like to go to open their ears , open the eyes , to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language .
And you can never know , you can get back from us .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : Hey , that I am .
From a child , my parents said , `` You can tell you everything , but then you 've got it . ''
The freedom does .
But my imagination was going to all these wonderful places , where everything was possible .
So I grew up in a bubble , or a bubble of ignorance , I should say , because the adults will be able to protect us from the bad truth .
When I 'm going to give you more , I learned that adults also <unk> and that they 're not very good to get the other other .
The time happened , I 'm now a adult , and I teach me and invention in the <unk> school <unk> .
You do n't expect a lot for that my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of plastic .
So as well as good citizens , we built the environment , and not , not , it 's not 10 , and if it 's , I do n't get it .
It 's sad to say , but today about 80 percent of the oceans are plastic .
It 's a little bit .
And in the last few decades , we 've been coming up with these big color and networks , to share those pieces of plastic to study the microscope , and the <unk> and <unk> this information in a map .
But it turns out , and it 's very expensive , and it 's also very expensive to use these huge .
So , I started with my students , with six to six years ago , you can take it with a better way .
We 've got our little classroom in Hong Kong in a garage .
We started building this kind of work with a little job that children can also participate .
And I 'm going to tell you , the children who are very great tools and they feel .
Not exactly .
Let 's go to the plastic .
With the plastic and we understand the size that we found in the ocean , which is very small , because it 's very small .
We do it .
I go to the imagination of my students .
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> in something we hope to work .
We decided that in a place of plastic , only <unk> information .
With the use of a robot , we take a picture of this plastic -- kids get a lot with robots .
And then we created what we call `` a prototype . ''
We are so fast in the creation of space that we ended up before .
And we have software and cameras , and we 'll get the web in order , and we 'll get it in a <unk> robot that move slowly , and by the plastic we have there , and this is the picture of the robot .
We can see the pieces of plastic mountains , even through the system as that the computer computer to process this image , and measure the size of each of the language , to get a bet of the amount of plastic in the water .
And I 'm going to get this invention to step in a website for a <unk> website called `` Wow , '' with the hope that someone else is still more .
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem , and you 're going to get them , they 're trying to be able to go back from the bottom .
[ I can tell you my local problem , but my students in Hong Kong are very good children .
You see the news , you get the Internet , and it 's <unk> with this picture .
A child , maybe less about 10 years ago , you know a oil of oil , just using the hands , in <unk> , the most larger world in the world in Bangladesh .
They were very surprised because this is the water , is the water , is the water in which you know , the water where they live .
You can see that the water is low , the <unk> and oil also are also from color , and when you get it on , it 's very hard to see what there 's in the water .
But there 's a simple technology called <unk> , which allows you to see what there is in the water .
We built a first prototype of a reactor that can be able to get through all sorts of subjects that produce different , which can help us understand what there is in the water .
I 'm going to get this prototype with a sensor , and we put it back to Bangladesh .
The great thing of this project is that more beyond that to solve a local problem , or we would put it a local problem , my students used to their empathy and their sense of creativity to help each other children .
[ I can show you a problem to a distance . I saw it to make a second experiment , and I wanted to go a little bit more far , maybe we build a little problem , and also more close to me .
I 'm half and half French , and maybe remember , that in 2011 , that in 2011 , that in 2011 , there was a single earthquake in Japan .
It was so violent that we 've got a lot of solar waves , called the road , and that 's a lot of cities in the coast of Japan .
More from 14 people died in a moment .
And also a day of nuclear energy , a nuclear nuclear system to the water .
And today , as a average of 300 tons are still based from the nuclear plant in the Pacific ocean .
Today , all of the Pacific , the Pacific has <unk> <unk> .
If we go to the West coast , we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere .
But if you look at the map , it seems to the most of the radiation came from the radiation , and most of time , of time , and most of time , it 's blue .
Well , the reality is a little bit more complicated than that .
I 've got a year from a year from the accident , and they brought it out with <unk> with other scientists , the land , the river , and then we wanted to take the children .
Of course we do n't have , parents do n't help it .
But every night at the center of control -- here you see the use of different mental use .
I could seem to get the reality work , but I know what they did , because they 're going to have to live with the <unk> .
And with them , we talked about the data <unk> that day , and we talk about what we were going to do , and we talk about what we were going to do later , the strategies .
And to do this , we create a map of <unk> <unk> of the region around the nuclear plant .
We created the map of authority , we 've been able to make data in the real time of the ghost , and it 's the water to take the rain .
And with this , we could notice that the dust dust came from from the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean .
And it was a lot of me .
But with the basis in this , we have a civil expedition , the more <unk> to the nuclear central to the face .
We go back to five miles from the nuclear central , and with the aid of the mission of the area we were able to bring out of the <unk> , with a <unk> , and we built it .
So here you see a progression : we 've gone from a local problem to a remote problem , a global problem .
And it 's been very exciting to work in these different scales , also with mental technologies .
But at the same time , it 's been every time , because we only 've been able to measure the evidence we 've done .
We do n't even started trying to solve the problems .
I ask me if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
So , the classroom became a little bit for the way , we found a industrial company in Hong Kong , and we put it in the biggest space in the biggest social impact and environmental .
It 's in the center of Hong Kong , and it 's a place where we can work with wood , metal , chemistry , a little of biology , basically , you can build almost all there .
It 's also a place where adults and children can play together .
It 's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults , and where adults can be children again .
DH : Dear !
<unk> <unk> : Let 's do things like , we can invent the future of the activity with energy energy ?
For example .
Or , we can help it in the <unk> of the population of American age are able to reduce their chairs in new vehicles ?
The plastic , oil and <unk> are <unk> , but the worst legacy we can stop our children are the species .
We ca n't allow us to protect the children of the bad truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions .
So , young citizens , <unk> , <unk> , we need to make the next generation for the environment and people , and so so I can actually do something about it .
Thank you .
Two , two , two cultures of real design design .
One is made of thousands of steel pieces , the other of a <unk> , the other one of a one of a single bit of silk .
One of them is , the <unk> another .
One of the <unk> in the environment , the other thing would have .
One is designed by nature , the other for it .
He said that when he looked at it , when he looked at the <unk> , he saw a way to be free .
And the <unk> was only a tool of scratch .
But the dignity are not <unk> .
They grow .
And in the most small units of life , the cells , we have all all the information to be able to work with every cell to work and to create it .
The tools also have consequences .
At least from the Industrial Revolution , the world 's world has been dominated by the <unk> of food and production .
The <unk> lines have experienced a world made of parts , <unk> the imagination of designers and engineers to think of their objects as a <unk> of parts with different systems .
But you do n't find a <unk> material in nature .
Think about the human skin , for example .
Our own designers are <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
The communities of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the end of the back .
You 're sort of similar as a environment , the other things like sustainable , and yet , it 's the same skin : there 's no place , there 's no <unk> .
It 's a system that 's going to be able to be able to be able to be through the <unk> variation .
Here 's a screen , which represents my view of the world is going to go up , the <unk> and a architect to work now in the <unk> and the gene , between the <unk> and the gene , between the <unk> and the gene , between the <unk> and the environment .
These two people from the world , my left , and the right , analysis and the right , shows it in the two <unk> after me .
My work , in your most simple level , it 's about to bring these two people from the world , we get all of the <unk> and they care of growth .
You know , why ?
Why do n't it it was possible this 10 or even five years ?
We live in a very special moment in history , a little moment , where we 've got four , where we 've got four , where we 've been able to make designers access to designers that we 've never had access to before .
And in the intersection of these four fields , my team and I created .
Please , you know the minds and the hands of my students .
We 're looking at objects , products , structures and tools and tools of a big scale , like this a robotic arm , like this robotic arm with a whole basis that some day I would not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to print the dark , and
So here we 've got to <unk> the parable , a catalyst of the ancient architecture , and it has created a screen where each of it is a screen where each of the one of the light of light and the heat through him .
In our next project , we 've got the possibility to create a layer and a sister . This was for a <unk> rate of Paris with <unk> are <unk> , is like a second skin made of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece .
So , with a <unk> of 3D printing , we 've built this layer , and there 's the layer of the ocean , and it 's a 3D phone , and I 'll show more objects like that .
Now , here 's a giant materials , and it 's going to go in the <unk> of 20 .
This is the sense of a human hair .
It 's also the <unk> of a <unk> .
And that designers have access to this high <unk> , and to the fact , it allows to design products that 's not only the way of our bodies , but also the <unk> structure of our tissues .
We also 've also designed a curve , a chair , a chair to the <unk> , so they also get sound .
The teacher says , my Cambridge , we came to nature , and to design this pattern of surface surface , becomes in <unk> .
And we 're going to get it this surface of different properties , they vary in Caltech , <unk> and color , <unk> the dots of pressure in the human body .
Their surface , as in nature , you can put it into the way of another material or another tree , but we 'll be able to be able to be able to protect it , and the intellectual property .
But it 's the ideal nature ?
Do n't have parts in nature ?
I 'm not born in a <unk> home , but when it was young , my grandmother told me stories from the Bible , and one of them came up and came to define a lot of what me matter .
As she says , `` In the third day of the <unk> , God 's going to get the Earth to make a <unk> tree to grow a <unk> . ''
To that first tree <unk> , there would n't have no difference between English , ladies and <unk> .
All of the tree was a player .
In change , the land made to grow trees with branches , cortex , <unk> and flowers .
The land created a world made of parts .
I often ask me , `` What would be the design if the objects would do a piece ?
Do you get a best state of creation ? ''
So , we 're looking at the <unk> material , the kind of material of the tree <unk> with men , and we found it .
The second <unk> <unk> in the planet is called <unk> , and about 100 billion tons , they produce every year by organisms as the shrimp , sir , and try .
We think that if we could take their properties , we could create structures structures in a piece .
So that 's what we did .
We call it a legal thing . You 've got a lot of <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
We 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to make a range of properties of properties , from dark , hard , to light , to light , to light and <unk> .
To print the structures structures , it was built a system with a little system with a lot of <unk> .
The robot could measure the properties of the material on the direction and create these structures made from a single material , 100 percent of the <unk> .
When the pieces of the pieces are ready to find a natural way in contact with the air .
So why we 're going to take designing with plastic ?
The <unk> bubbles who were a origin of the printing process to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to be able to have been able to have a thousand billion years ago , like we hear yesterday .
He with our <unk> in Harvard , and the MIT , <unk> the bacteria built to slow carbon from the atmosphere and make it in sugar .
At the first time , we 've been able to create structures that they do their transition to do n't , and if it 's still more , to windows .
A tree <unk> <unk> .
He worked with a old material , one of the first forms of life in the planet , with free water , and with a little of biology biology , we 've got a structure made out of dogs in a architecture that came up as a tree .
And here 's the best part : for objects that 's designed to be , in the sea , we get all in the sea , <unk> life , and put on the floor , they will get a tree .
The windows for our next exploration using the same principles principles was the solar system .
We 're looking at the possibility to create clothes to keep the life for the <unk> .
To do that , we need to lose the bacteria and control their flow .
So as the table went on , we did our own table table : new ways of life , and new ways of life had been born , made out of a biological way .
I like to think in biology biology as the <unk> , only that in <unk> metals , it 's all new psychological metals , and it 's all new features in a very small quality .
This field is called <unk> .
We 'll be able to be able to be able to control the flow of these <unk> crops .
In our first piece of clothes , you 've got to get up .
The first is the <unk> .
They live in our oceans and in the <unk> .
And the second , Denmark , the bacteria that happened in the human , the bacteria .
One becomes the light in sugar , the other <unk> <unk> , and it 's using sexual malaria for the built environment .
But these two thirds do n't interact in nature .
In fact , never lost .
They are here , designed for the first time , to have a relationship in a piece of clothes .
Think about it as evolution , not for natural selection , but evolution for design .
We 've created these relationships , we 've created a only city that 's called the <unk> <unk> , which helps you to get out of these bacteria , and that 's going to get their function .
And so we started to get those of the income in the human body , <unk> the properties of the material as well .
If we wanted to do more , we 'll have the more <unk> more building .
So this system 's <unk> system , when they get out of a end of the end of another , it 's 60 meters .
This is half of the length of a <unk> field , and 10 times more than our own <unk> .
And here is , as well , as you go in TED , our first <unk> , <unk> , and a brilliant <unk> in life .
Thank you .
Mary said , `` We 're there , there are basic creatures , only half is done . ''
What if the design would get the other half ?
And if we could create structures who are living ?
And if we could create a little lot of personal , <unk> the tissue , and we 'll get our bodies ?
Think about this as a way of finding biology .
I call this the material .
To it , there 's always to go back to nature .
Now , right now , you know that a 3D printer used a material .
They also know that nature does n't do this .
It 's <unk> .
This one of the <unk> , for example , creates a very sophisticated society , a home inside of the which is <unk> .
People do n't know about this level of sophistication .
It does n't take the combination of the combination of two materials , but of two different proteins in different institutions .
One changes like structure , the other is the white or the ball , they brought these malaria between yes .
And this happens through scales .
Now , the <unk> of course you first come on in the middle environment , created a structure of cell , and then it begins to be able to be able to be able to get it out .
Now , we 've got it , and we know , the two of life , the two of life , they were born in a single material .
With the end of understanding better how it works , we make a complex process , we make a little bit to the head of a disease , to the top .
We put it into a box with <unk> sensors , and that allows us to create this cloud cloud in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of a disease .
And yet , when you look at the creation of silk , not inside a box , not inside a box , we realized that it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it back .
So we started to design different environments , different Venter , and we 've found that the way , we 've found that the way , the structure of the <unk> , it goes directly directly through the environment .
And often , you 're often going to be able to be able to be able to give them to death inside their faith , their disease is going to come up and it uses in the entire industry .
We saw that we start to build these cardboard , we can give the good way to the <unk> disease without the only one .
It 's <unk> , and we could create these things .
So let 's take this process to the high scale .
We had a robot to be able to make food , and we put us in our website .
We knew that the result of <unk> , and it 's going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , so we use a diagram of the solar route to calculate the distribution of light and the heat in our structure .
And then we create holes or <unk> , to create the air of light , and the heat , uses the creation of disease on the structure .
We were prepared to come to the stethoscope .
You 've got a lot of silk to a range of disease .
And then after a hundred weeks ago , they were prepared to come with us .
We put it up in the bottom of the cows , and as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> eggs , and life begins again , but a lot of , a lot of a lot .
Reagan says that the machine is the great integrity , and he was right .
And when it 's a biological matter about silk <unk> , you give all this signal their imagination .
And in a little of two or three weeks ago , you 'll go through a thousand thousand years ago .
In a little symmetry , this is also the length of the route of silk .
<unk> , after the <unk> , they produce five billion eggs .
This could be used for 250 kilos in the future .
So here are the two of the world .
A <unk> <unk> by a robotic arm , the other different dimensions .
If the end of the design of design is to give life to the products and the buildings that we get up , to form one of two materials , the designers have taken these two people from the world .
What we 're going to go back , of course , at the beginning .
So here 's a new era of design , a new era of creation , which makes us a design design in nature to a nature of nature , that we 'll bring us from us , for the first time , that we make us in nature .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Your hand if you 've ever asked , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
If you had to remember what age were when they asked the first time this ?
They can <unk> with the fingers .
Three . Five . Five . Five .
Now , look at the hand if the question , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
They have been built some kind of gun .
No .
I 'm somebody who could never answer to the question `` What do you want to be going to be going to be more ? ''
The problem was n't that I did n't have any interest , but I had too many .
In school , I was like English , and the joy and the art , and the art , and then , it 's going to call the guitar in a third band called <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you 've heard about us .
And in general , I like to show you , and it 's all of all , we 've been able to have a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field .
But with the time , this sense of us , this feeling is not a challenge , it comes to <unk> .
And I have to give you .
But then I 'm going to go through another thing , something completely different , and I 'm going to say it in it , and I 'll tell you , and I 'm going to leave you , and I 'm going to leave `` Yes ! I 've found the God , '' and then again again , I 've found my God .
And finally , I want to tell you .
But then I 'd like to discover something new and different , and I 'd like to go back in that .
This pattern was a lot of clothes , for two reasons .
The first was because I was n't sure about how I was going to turn everything in a career .
I thought I had to choose one thing , where we were able to choose one thing , where we 'll get it to <unk> .
Another reason why I was a little bit of me was a little bit more personal .
I knew that there was a bad thing in this , and something bad in me for me .
I tried to have afraid to the commitment , or going to get it out , or to <unk> , or the <unk> or my own success .
If you can figure out my story and these feelings , I 'd like to ask you something I 'd like to have to have a girl .
Let 's ask themselves , where I learned to minimize the meaning of bad or vehicles to do things .
I 'll tell you where you learned : I learned about the culture .
They ask us , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
When we have about five years .
And the truth is that no one matter what you get to that age .
You know , it 's a question that 's going to take answers to make answers to the kids like , `` You 'll be a <unk> , '' or `` I 'll be play . ''
I 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it out of this .
Now , this question is a question , and again as many of a lot of different ways , you know , to the high students , the question you 're going to choose in college .
And in some time , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
It 's going to be a nice exercise of before what we get us to sleep .
Why ?
If you look at this question , the kids to sleep with what they could be , they do n't take me to sleep with everything they could be .
In fact , it 's just the opposite , because when someone would tell you what you want to be , you can not answer with 20 things , but if you look so well , you know , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , `` Oh , ``
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Bob , and he 's going to go out of it and <unk> .
And here , I know , <unk> of Richard magazine in <unk> , you know , a teacher and a creative .
But most of the kids do n't hear about people like this .
All of what you hear is that they 're going to choose .
But it 's more than that .
The notion of life life is very important in our culture .
It 's this idea of the fate , or the true thing , the idea that each of us has something to have something that you have to get for their time in this land , and you have to figure out what 's that thing and read their life .
But if you are somebody who 's not connected to this way ?
What if there 's a lot of different issues that would show her curiosity and many things that wants to do ?
There 's no place for someone as one in that .
And so you can feel only .
You can feel that it does n't have a goal .
And I feel that there 's something bad with one .
There 's no bad thing in you .
You 're a <unk> .
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interest and different activities .
It 's a breath for that .
You could help you if you go in three parts : Two , potential and <unk> .
You can also use some other terms that <unk> the same idea of the same idea .
For the time of the <unk> , the ideal was who I was good <unk> in multiple .
It 's going to be <unk> to us as `` Wow . ''
You 'll get any term that you do , or <unk> one .
It seems like a species of building a community , we ca n't be able to be with a single identity .
It 's easy to see the <unk> as the limitation , or I suspect you have to drive .
But what I 've learned with people and writing about these ideas in my website , is that there 's huge strengths to be that way .
Here 's three <unk> .
One : The <unk> of ideas .
I mean , the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> their interests in terms of data , except of data , speaks , mathematics and design .
<unk> is a company that would actually think of <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> , and he turned up in this idea , only by their <unk> of skills and experiences .
The innovation happens in the neighborhood .
And there 's the new ideas .
And the <unk> , with all their system , you can have access to a great amount of these kind of intersection .
The second <unk> <unk> is learning learning .
When the <unk> will have us for something , we go to it .
We 're seeing what we can have in our hands .
We 're used to be as well , because it 's a lot of times in the past , and this means that we have less afraid to make things new things and come from our areas of comfort .
A lot of skills are <unk> to other smart , and we 've got all all what we 've learned to every new area that we understand , so they still started from zero .
<unk> <unk> is a little bit of real time , and a <unk> .
As a child , a amazing capacity of develop the amazing memory .
Now , it 's the more fast <unk> .
I had to become a student , <unk> it was a biological .
And he had to learn the quantum mechanics of the longest communication , and this ability to help their practice , and this ability to make a little bit of a surprising thing for the advice .
I 'm going to be a loss of time to have to come to what you do , even if the end of the day .
It 's possible to have that knowledge in a completely different field , in a way you could n't have .
The third <unk> <unk> is the <unk> . It 's to say , the ability to be in any thing that you 've got in a given situation .
<unk> <unk> is sometimes sometimes director of videos , other , a designer designer , sometimes a half times , sometimes a teacher , and sometimes , as well , as well , as well , as well , as well , as well .
It 's valuable because a good job .
He 's still more valuable because it can take different penguins , depending from the needs of their customers .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the most important ability for the development , to go in the 21st century .
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market , which is actually going to go .
<unk> of ideas , fast learning : three skills where the <unk> are very painful , and three skills that you could lose if they are a little bit for reduce their goals .
And as society , we have a great interest in order to the <unk> that they 're doing .
We have complex problems , we do right now , and we need to produce creative , and we need to be creative , they need to make them creative .
Let 's say you are , in your heart .
They were able to come out of the <unk> , because they wanted to be overweight .
They do n't know , there 's no bad thing in you .
In fact , some of the world 's better , you get them from a button and a <unk> <unk> .
You can go up in the depth and put in practice and put in practice , and the <unk> <unk> a <unk> of knowledge .
It 's a beautiful relationship .
But we all should design lives and <unk> that <unk> with the way we 're connected .
And unfortunately , in course , the <unk> in a big part of us to be able to be more like their <unk> .
One time said this , if there 's one thing that you get from this talk , I hope that it 's this : <unk> with the physical phenomenon , which is what it 's .
If you do it , it 's a heart of heart , then <unk> all of the media .
This is where you 'll give you the best .
But for the <unk> in the room , including those who you 've got to be one of them in the last 12 minutes , I tell you : <unk> with their many passions .
It 's a curiosity by those <unk> .
We 'll be able to get them up .
We 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to make us a larger life and happy .
And maybe the most important thing , <unk> , the world needs us .
Thank you .
In the year , a woman called <unk> <unk> to a <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and I could n't remember the most basic details of their life .
His doctor was called <unk> .
And I did n't know how to help it , but it 's <unk> by her until that , unfortunately , he made it on .
After her death , I 'll be born , and they found a little bit and they were found a lot of a few , and then the brain 's brain , from a kind of kind of kind of before you 've never seen .
The most amazing thing .
If you could have been alive today , we could n't give it to her help her help , which is the <unk> that I gave it a couple years ago .
<unk> was Dr. <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> , the first patient in having a diagnosis that now we do disease disease .
From course , medicine has a lot .
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections , a lot of treatments for cancer , you get for HIV and much more .
But a little has been known in the treatment treatment .
I 'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for the density of a decade .
So I think about this all the time .
The disease now affects 40 billion across the world .
But in 2050 , it 's going to go to 150 billion than , by the way , we put a lot of you .
If you 're able to live until the 25 years or more , the possibility of them are almost one of each two .
In other words , there 's the probability of that they put their years with Alzheimer 's disease , or help me care about a friend or it 's going to get it .
It 's just in the U.S. , the risk of violence costs billion dollars every year .
One of five dollars of a medical dollars in the medical disease .
Today , it 's the more expensive disease , and their costs costs a half times a half times in the year yesterday , as well , as the generation of the coral .
It may be , but the disease is one of the biggest challenges and social challenges of our generation .
But it has been relatively a little bit for it .
Today , one of the 10 first impact of all the world , the violence is the only that you ca n't prevent , cure or even a drug .
We understand of the systems that of other diseases , because we 've spent less time and money in the research research .
The government of the United States spend 10 times more every year in the research research that in the fact of the fact that makes us more pollution and cause a number a number of deaths like cancer .
The lack of resources is because of a most fundamental cause : human consciousness .
Because this is what a few people knows , but all the world should be : violence is a disease , and we can try .
To the most part of the last 20 years , all , even , scientists , they are not , and the scientists .
We think it 's going to be <unk> in a normal part , and it 's kind of <unk> .
But there 's only look at a picture of a brain , and it 's a healthy brain in comparison with a <unk> patient to see the real physical system built by this disease .
It 's also able to be able to take a strong loss of memory and social skills , the damage of the brain built by the <unk> and it 's always deadly .
Remember , Dr. violence found Reagan , and so <unk> in the brain 's brain has a century .
For almost a century , we did n't know about this .
We know , we know that they 're made of mass molecules .
And you can think a molecule of protein as a piece of paper that becomes a origami .
There 's places in paper who are a <unk> .
And when you go through , these guys would actually end up in the inside .
But sometimes the things they go wrong , and some of the <unk> dots are in the outside .
Now , this makes the molecules molecules to take it out between yes , including groups that can be able to form big leukemia and so forth .
That 's what we see in the brain of patients with violence .
We 've spent the last 10 years in Cambridge University trying to understand how it works .
There 's a lot of steps , and the appearance of what a lot of institution is complex , like a bomb .
<unk> a wire could do anything .
<unk> the others can make the bomb .
You have to find the right step of the right , and then create a drug that you do .
As a little bit , in the most of the most you have to get the wires , and they get the best .
But now there 's a single group of people , doctors , biologists , including , chemicals , chemicals , engineers , engineers and mathematicians .
And together , we 've been able to measure a critical step in the process . Now , it 's taken a new kind of drugs that carries this step to stop the disease .
I 'll show you some of our last results .
No one of our lab is still still .
Let 's look at videos from what happened to test these drugs .
These are the healthy , and you can see that they move up with you .
These are now , by another hand , they have molecules molecules that they get up between each other , like in human beings .
And you can see that they are clearly sick .
But to give our new drugs in a early stage in a early stage , then we see it and live a normal life .
This is just a particular result , but the research like this shows that the violence is a disease that we can understand and cure .
And after 60 years ago , there are hope of what it can be in the next 10 or 20 years .
But for that , that 's going to be that hope , from <unk> , we need help .
It 's not about scientists like me , is about you .
We need to be <unk> from the violence is a disease , and if we 're trying to do it .
In the case of other diseases , the patients and their families have been the more research , and they have the whole families in governments , and the local industry , about scientists .
That was essential to move in the HIV treatment in the end of the '80s .
Today we see that same unit to treat cancer .
But the patients patients ca n't talk about themselves .
And their families , the <unk> victims , looking at their own day , and night , they are often too <unk> to get back and move for change .
So , it really depends from you .
It 's not , in most cases of a genetic disease .
All of the world with a brain to be the risk .
Today , there 's 40 million patients like <unk> , you can not create the change that you need to do .
And I 'm going to talk about them , and help 's help a cure .
Thank you .
So I 'm wearing this article in the New York Times , in January of this year .
Now , to take you from somebody , do this .
The article is about a little study , designed to create love love in the lab , and in my own experience to the try to try to try to try me at the past summer .
So , the procedure is pretty simple : Two , <unk> <unk> to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a lot of questions , and then they look at the eyes without talk about four minutes .
Here 's a couple of questions of example .
Number 12 : If you could put up morning with a quality or ability , what would be ?
Man : When it was the last time you 've got to get back to another person ?
And just ?
It 's supposed to change , these are every time .
Number 30 : This is actually like -- you 'll give your partner , what I 'm going to tell you about him , or she , I know so I know , I know , I know , I know , I know things that you 've heard .
When I put up with this study a few years ago , a detail I actually called the attention , the <unk> of the participants had been written six months later , and I decided to all about the lab .
So , I was interested on this process of making romantic love love , but since after it , also I was also invented .
And when I had the time to test this study , with somebody who knew not very well , I did n't expect it .
No , we put them , and I thought that was a good story , so I thought that the <unk> to the <unk> floor , a few months later .
That was published in January , and now , it 's because unfortunately , so I guess that some of you are probably ask : we do n't ask ?
And the reason I think it 's going to do this is because I 've done this question a question , and again in the last seven months .
And of this question is what I want to talk about today .
But let 's go to the topic .
One week before you gave the article was very nervous .
I had been working in a high book in the last years , so , I had to write to write about my experience in my love in my love .
But one of it can come to a few years ago as much , and those were usually only my friends from Facebook and I realized that my article in the New York Times is probably about thousands of years .
And that 's a good amount of attention in a relatively new relationship .
But as he gave it , I did n't have idea .
The article had been born in line , a afternoon for the night , and then it happened , this happened in the traffic of my blog .
And the walk , I 've had been called the patient , and the <unk> <unk> .
In a month , the article was born more than eight billion dollars , and I was , to say something , a little thing for this kind of attention .
One thing is to be able to deal with the way to make us in the own experiences , but another thing is to discover that the infinite life of one has been news news , and the people from all the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship .
And when people called it or writing , what did each day for weeks , always , made the same question : do n't all first ?
In fact , when I was looking at this talk , I did a quick search search to the <unk> of my email with the phrase , `` No ? ''
And a few messages came down .
They were from students and journalists and <unk> , like this .
I 'm going on the radio and did it .
Even , I gave a talk , and a woman looked at the stage , `` Hey , where it 's your sister ? ''
And I looked at the red .
I understand that this is part of the attempt .
If you have a lot of your relationship in a international classroom , you should expect that the people are going to explain to tell you about it .
But I was not , for the <unk> of the answer .
The 25 questions would n't have <unk> life .
In fact , the New York Times had been a article in the <unk> , which tells us the experiences of democracy to the study of the study with different degrees degrees .
So , my first train to all this attention was going to be out with my own relationship .
And I said , I 'm not to each of them to get a public environment .
<unk> interviews interviews , and he took the <unk> of photographs of us two .
I think that I was afraid to come in the <unk> of the <unk> process of <unk> , a range of the <unk> that I did n't felt like it .
And I understand that people did n't want to know , if the study worked , they wanted to know if it was actually , or it 's , if I was able to be able to produce love love , not only one , but it 's just a sense , but love .
But this was a question that I do n't felt for answer .
My relationship was just a few months ago , and I felt , about everything , who people do the wrong question .
How do you know if you go together or not , and then you 'll also go back ?
If the answer is not , would make the experience of doing these three questions , less interesting ?
Dr. Venter wrote first about these questions in this same study in Indonesia , and there , the goal of the <unk> was not to produce love love .
In time , I was starting to be able to be able to be able to be able to go up between students , using what it was called <unk> , etc. , and Shoots .
It sounds .
But the study I know .
The participants had been closer to do it . You 've also actually used the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust , and interaction between strangers .
They have been used between members of the police and the community , and they have been used between people from <unk> policies .
The original version of the story of history , which was the age of the past , which speaks three questions with four minutes of a visual contact minutes , it was built in this article , but unfortunately , never found .
A few months ago , I was giving a talk at a small school school , and then a student came back to me and said with yesterday , I 'm going to tell you , I 'm looking at the study and not work .
He seemed like it .
And I know , you want to tell you that you 're going to tell you about the person with you ?
Well , he made it .
I think it 's just want to be friends .
And I said , but he got better friends ?
Do you know , you know , I know the best after the study ?
He 's going .
So , it worked . ''
Now , I do n't think that that was the answer that he looked at .
In fact , I do n't think it 's the answer that none of you are looking at when it 's about love .
I looked at the study for the first time when I was born in the first time when I was born in the first time .
I had to have that relationship since I had 20 , which was supposed to have all all my life life , and he was my first love , and he was not , and I did n't have a idea of how or if I could live without him .
So , I 'm going to go in science .
I know , I could find everything that I could find about the science of the romantic love , and I realized that that I could be able to do the heart .
I do n't know if I realized about this in the moment I thought , I thought , to the book that I would write , in perspective , seems really obvious .
I thought , if I gave me with the knowledge of the romantic love , you never would have to be able to feel so wrong and used as I felt .
And all this knowledge has been useful from a or another way .
I 'm more patient with love .
I have more trust in order to go .
But I can also tell you more clearly , and I can realize that what I look at is sometimes more than what you look at it 's to me .
What I 'll look at the love is a <unk> , not just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be born today , but I 'll continue to be able to be able to get the person to the person that I love .
It may be that this is the <unk> that people asked when they wanted to know if we 're still together .
Now , the story that American media is that you can have a few questions is that you can have a lot of a <unk> .
It may have a way to explore something of the risk risk , and this is a very popular story , because it turned up to make us feel fun , but it 's also terrible .
But I think when it 's about the love , we 're very willing to accept the short version of the story .
The version of the story that question : do n't do ?
And their content with a answer .
So , more than a question , you know , we do things more hard , questions like : How do you tell you who deserves your love and who do n't ?
How do you go on , when the things do n't ? You know , and how to know when you can know when you can know ?
How do you live with the uncertainty that you use a relationship ? Or even more , how you live with your partner ?
I do n't know the answers to these questions , but I think it 's a good beginning to have a conversation conversation about what it means to love someone .
So if you want to the short version of the story of my relationship of my relationship , is this ; it makes a year , a known , a day , a known and I built a study designed to create love love , we put them together , and I 'm very happy .
But it 's not the same thing to go in .
<unk> is the easy part .
So at the end of my article wrote : The love does n't happen .
<unk> <unk> , because we take the choice .
And I got a little bit of the return now , not because it 's not because it 's not , but because in the moment , I did n't know what that choice .
I do n't have a few times we have both to take that decision , and so you 'll have to be able to be doing that choice without knowing before if he was always choose or not .
I want you to be enough to have , and let 's give you a couple of questions , I have to be able to love someone as possible , but so fun , and have to get that choice in the biggest day in the United States .
But what I 've done , in change , it 's going to turn my relationship in the kind of myth that I do n't think about .
And what I see , and what maybe I spend my life looking for it is that that myth is true .
I want to the end of the <unk> in the title of my article , which is , the only part of the article that I actually do n't wrote .
But what I 've got in change is the opportunity to take someone , and the hope that he also love me , and it 's terrible , but it 's terrible , but it 's the deal with the love .
Thank you .
I was born by a <unk> , and in the way I got as a <unk> <unk> .
In the city of New York makes a time , something that I actually was really surprised , but more than much more .
I start with when I was eight years ago .
I took a box box , and <unk> a <unk> box , a little bit of a dollar , a pencil and a producer in her one place .
And I thought , I thought , I 've got a little bit or a lot of a lot of this box a few years later and <unk> how our kind of ideas , for example , how we eat them .
I had no idea .
In all of ways , it 's like because here I 'm , 30 years later , and I still do .
In a moment , because I was in Hawaii -- I like to go back and do it , and all of those things , and I was doing a little bit for my mother .
And I took a dictionary , and I found all of the pages and I had a kind of <unk> <unk> by <unk> Martin -- the <unk> of a <unk> and a bee was born .
Well , my mother has afraid to the bees and it 's <unk> to them , so I found more in the Congo , thinking that I could <unk> .
In change , it happened the opposite : somehow it seemed to be a size of size , like if it was that <unk> the text with a island .
So I did ? I built more .
This time , I started to try to try to try to have a little elements , <unk> , wonderful forests that I was finding by the street , everything I could find , because I was looking for things about all my life , trying to figure out of these objects .
So I had to draw around the objects , and I realized that my God can draw in space .
And I can <unk> <unk> , I would draw as you know about a <unk> in the environment .
And I took the objects , and I created my own <unk> of amazing .
First of course , the ones that you can have a idea .
And then I did about insects and creatures .
It was very fun to draw in the subway .
And it was a great , because I started to pull up , and those things , and I was putting a little bit of money , to give me my girlfriend to me , for example , go to <unk> .
It was great , man .
In some time , I 've been interested by the human way , a <unk> of a natural size of human beings in the dollar .
It was great , except by one thing : I 'll give me .
I did n't know what to do , because I was going to fight .
And I was going to bed every night in that .
So I tried to use glass .
I started to draw in the glass of glass , similar to the drawing in a window , then in another window , and I had all these windows together , and I had all these windows together and had all these windows together .
And this really worked , and so I could go to use the garden .
So I did this for years , and my work <unk> with a very big thing , which I call `` Wow . ''
Now , for the <unk> , '' I was inspired in a great as `` The garden '' '' from the advent , '' which is a painting in the National Museum in Spain .
You know ?
Well , it 's a great picture .
They say it 's a little bit of their time .
Well , the `` Wow . ''
It was 11 kilos .
It 's a square meters .
It 's a lot of face , by what it 's 10 meters of wealth .
It 's a little bit .
Well , that 's the source of blood .
On the left , it 's written and the air .
There 's a cave where all of these creatures with two worlds .
They 're going to go from the world 's world , to this sort of <unk> , where they get together .
So here is where the creatures with local animals are going to put them to the way , you give them to make it to make their mass <unk> in the ocean .
The ocean is made of thousands of elements .
This is a bird god to a <unk> .
Let me know , it 's in the sea ; the <unk> , which is <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> , there 's all sorts of things that you can find if you look at the ocean .
And so well also a species of <unk> .
It 's coming out of the ocean , and they lose oil in a hand while the other hand come up .
Their hands are like <unk> , and it seems to be the <unk> to be the Earth and the cosmos in balance .
So , it 's a aspect of the <unk> .
It 's a little narrative .
That 's the hand in the <unk> .
And then , when you go back to the other hand , it has a boss , like a <unk> of bird , and they lose the <unk> of this .
You also have a tail of 86 meters old , a tail that would put the `` Wow . ''
In every way , his tail to fire the <unk> in a volcano .
I do n't know why happened .
Things who go , you know .
His tail goes up in a balloon <unk> of <unk> <unk> in 1986 .
You have seen ?
They did in the 1970s , as if they were from the <unk> of the terrorists .
Very <unk> to her time . This is allowed to my last project .
I 'm a half projects : One is called `` <unk> . ''
It 's about a project of six years to do 100 of these humans .
Every one is a projection of our culture , through media and material , and material , or they 're born .
But each of you use as a sort of <unk> in a way of being human , and then in groups of 20 , four or 12 to time .
They 're like cells , they 're getting together .
And you can walk between them . It 's a few years .
Every one is basically a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a human .
This has a little cave in the chest .
That 's the head ; it 's the chest , you can <unk> the <unk> .
I 'm going to give you for the rest of the body : there 's a waterfall that comes from the chest , and that 's a waterfall that comes out of the head or <unk> , or what it 's a kind of kind of <unk> .
And it 's a quick way of these work , because I ca n't get it up for a long time .
We have layers , you can see .
This is a <unk> body from half .
This has two heads , and it 's going on between the two .
There 's a whole day that come up and come in the head of this strange box .
There 's a little scene in the top of the beginning .
Can you see it ?
Now , you know , this talk is about these boxes , like the <unk> in which we live .
We 're in a box , the solar system is a box .
This is allowed me to my last box .
It 's a box box . It 's called <unk> <unk> .
And in this box , there 's a physical , a professor , a professor , a camera , a student , a writer , a writer , a program of radio , a arm , a arm , a arm , a arm , a arm , which is a arm that we do in the world .
I 'll get the box , and all the people in place with other people like particles .
And I think that 's the way to change the world .
When you show you who is and the box in which is living .
And together we 've got to realize that we 're all together in this , that this illusion that we are different , these concepts of countries , of the law , of religion , it does n't work .
We 're all very facts from the same matter and in the same box .
And if we do n't start to take those things with being able to come up , and we 're all going to die very soon .
Thank you very much .
What do you do when you give you the head ?
They get a place .
But for that , it needs to be on the pain , first happens by the stomach , the chickens and other organs .
It 's the most effective system that 's the more effective system to be able to be able to make any effect in the body .
People , yet , it 's that the <unk> of any drug .
And this is a big problem , especially in HIV patients .
When you take these drugs , these they use the amount of virus in the blood , and we get the <unk> of cells .
But they 're also known by their effects out of their effects , in their majority , because in time , because in the time that you start to get to the air , it 's <unk> , and worse , and worse , and worse , and worse , and worse even for the time that 's going to get their destiny .
These are regions of the body as the Himalayas , the nervous system , the nervous system , where the virus is , and it 's not going to be able to do it , and it 's not going to do it in the blood mountains of the patients who are sold to social drugs .
And yet , after the risk of the treatment , the virus can come up and connect new cells .
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the political drugs that is a treatment treatment of life .
One day , I felt , and I thought , `` We could do the treatment of the virus , without the risk of the drugs ? ''
As a scientific piece of scientific , the answer was in front of me , the <unk> , of course .
If you use it in <unk> , for the positive care and surgery , you can be used for any other thing you see , including the <unk> <unk> .
In fact , we 're going to using a bubble of laser to open or 45 black holes , which you can get up and find almost immediately the cell cells with HIV drugs .
You 're going to say , `` How is that possible ? ''
We 've got a little and extremely powerful <unk> on the cell cell in the HIV cell as that these cells are available in a liquid that 's got the drug .
It turns up to the cell , while the cell becomes the drug in the question of us .
Before we even realize , the hole is <unk> immediately .
We 're seeing this technology in cows , or in course , but the goal is going to take this technology to the human body , we get the human body .
`` How is that possible ? ''
Well , the answer is : through a <unk> device .
With the first head , which is our laser , we 'll make a <unk> in the website of infection .
The second head , which is a camera , you get to the website of the infection .
On the last , the third head , a <unk> that the drug is going directly on in the website of the infection , while the bubble is building again to keep the cells .
Well , this is not a lot of time .
But one day , if you have success , this technology can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to drive the total of HIV muscle .
Yes . A cure for HIV .
This is the dream of all of HIV -- in our case , a treatment treatment .
Thank you .
In the last decade , I 've found in the last decade , they were n't trained , organizations organizations , and organizations , but they were born or <unk> .
<unk> what these groups who do these groups when they do n't .
My goal is to understand the best to these of violence , and we study ways of the transition of the transition transition to the <unk> .
I do work from field , in the world of politics and in the library .
Let 's tell these groups is key to solve everything conflict in course , because the war has changed .
It used to be a route between states .
No .
Now , it 's a conflict between the states and democracies .
Now , for example , of the <unk> <unk> of peace , and 2011 , <unk> , <unk> between a state , and a <unk> actor .
So , we need to understand these groups ; we even need to use or <unk> , or <unk> in any process of understanding of the successful conflict .
But how do it do it ?
We have to know what these organizations .
We know the reasons why they fight , how do you do it , but nobody does , but nobody does what they do n't .
It 's the hot fight , and the political fight .
Everything is part of the same organization .
We ca n't understand these groups , not a lot of <unk> , without a global vision .
The <unk> groups of today are different organizations .
For example , the <unk> <unk> , known by their <unk> , against Israel .
From their creation in the 1970s , <unk> also has a political game , a network of social services and a <unk> device .
Now , in the same way , the <unk> <unk> , known by their <unk> of Israel against Israel , we also be able to get the advent of Indonesia from 2007 .
So these groups do more than just stop .
They 're sorry .
It 's a complex of communication , waves of radio , <unk> of television , sites of the Internet and strategies in social networks .
And here you have the magazine magazine , <unk> in English , and I 've been found to treat them .
The <unk> groups are also going to invest in a <unk> , but using business , for example , in example , in example .
These activities are key .
They allow them to these groups increase their organization , increase their support , to make the best and build their face .
The <unk> groups are also doing something more : create more strong , you have more strong , very strong .
We build schools , there are hospitals , you put it in the way of a professional programs or in fact .
<unk> , all these services and more .
The <unk> groups also try to take the population that the state is not , and security and protection .
And the one of the Taliban in the Taliban in the war or even at the beginning of the <unk> , can be able to be able to look at the efforts of these groups for you security .
Unfortunately , in these cases , security has a price price for the population .
But , in general , you can have social services means to be able to show you a vacuum , a <unk> gap by the government , and they allowed to these groups and increase their power .
Now , for example , I put them from 2006 from 2006 , not can be able to be able to recognize the social social work .
It 's a really complex stage , even in the West , when we look at the Arctic groups , we just think about the violent side .
But that 's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups , the strategy or the view of the way .
These groups are responsible .
They were because they 're able to make the <unk> of the government , and they 're going to get as <unk> and political groups , in the violent and they give them .
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations , less , we can have <unk> as a state .
How do you go to a group like <unk> ?
It 's a part of a territory , you get all their functions , they get the <unk> , you get the system .
Is it a state ? It 's a autonomous group ?
Or maybe it 's another thing , something new and different .
And what do it happen ?
The lines are <unk> .
We live in a world of states , from nations , and the more <unk> , and the most carbon are the states , like in the Middle East East , more likely and make that gap .
This is important for governments , because to draw these groups , they have to invest in the tools they are not military tools .
It 's going to be able to be able to be in the center of any sustainable approach .
This is very important also to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make them .
If we understand the best groups , let 's say better what incentives to be able to get the transition of violence to violence .
In this new route between states and actors , the power power can be able to make some doors , but we do n't give peace or efficiency .
To get these goals , we need to make a lot of common health , to fill that high amount of the security of security , to show that <unk> of government who allowed to these groups .
Thank you .
I 'm a failure as a woman and as a <unk> .
My opinions of gender equality are <unk> , but I 'm afraid to accept the <unk> of `` <unk> '' would be available for them .
I 'm a <unk> , but pretty bad .
And so I 'm so <unk> as a bad category .
Or , at least , I wrote a article , and a book called `` The <unk> , '' and then in the interviews , people started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
So , what I started like a joke , I was able to me , and it has become a lot of it , has become a larger thing .
Let me give you a step back .
When I was young , about all in my village and 20 years ago , I had a few ideas about people , these women <unk> , I know with the men , and they do sex .
Today , I see how they are these women in all the world and the day , in particular , it looks like a huge answer .
But in the time , I was worried about the tone that I was using people to be able to be a <unk> .
It 's going to be <unk> as a <unk> , a <unk> word .
I 'm like <unk> as a woman who does n't go to the rules , which is too much , with high self-esteem , and you know to believe that it 's like or a man .
No one wants to be that <unk> woman , until you realize that actually is that woman , and you ca n't imagine be another person .
With the time , as I went to growing , I started to accept that I 'm , in fact , <unk> , and also , proud of it .
To me , certain of us are <unk> : women are the same men .
<unk> the same of the same work .
We have right to travel through the world as the <unk> , free or violence .
We have right to use a easy way and accessible and services and services .
We have the right to decide about our bodies , not need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> it .
We have the right to respect .
There 's more .
When you talk about the needs of women , you have to have to realize our other colors .
We are not only women .
We are people with a different body , gender expression , religion and change , social skills and much more .
We have to have to realize these differences , and how do we affect us , in the same way that matter what we have in common .
I do n't know this kind of variation , our pleasure is not nothing .
To me , these truths are researching , but to be clear : I 'm a disaster .
I 'm full of contradictions .
There 's a lot of things that make me a bad bit .
I have another confession .
When I 'm going to work , I hear music <unk> .
And if the letter led to women , and I really feel deeply , the <unk> <unk> '' from the Antarctic <unk> is amazing .
`` We actually do it with your <unk> .
<unk> , I 'll take it , <unk> until you get it . ''
Think about it .
<unk> poetry , not ?
I 'm completely surprised by my <unk> .
I think , in the work of the man , which is everything I do n't want to do , including -- all of the young tasks , but they also support insects , the <unk> of Cambridge , the price of <unk> .
I do n't want to have nothing to do with that .
This is my favorite color .
I 'll be able to get out of the computer , and the magic things .
And I can see `` The <unk> '' and the love , and I 've got to make it out of the stories that they do actually .
Some of my <unk> are more <unk> .
If a woman wants to tell the past of his husband , it 's their choice , and I 'm not who to get you to you .
If a woman could be able to go home for their children , I would get that choice , also .
The problem is not that it 's going to become vulnerable through this same choice , the problem is that our society is <unk> , which makes the women are extremely vulnerable when they eat .
Let 's get this problem .
And we 'll be able to get the key bit that it does , or it turns out the needs of the color of color , and the white , white , white women , in a average and high women and high women .
Listen , if that 's a very bad <unk> .
It 's also happening the next : as a <unk> , I feel a lot of pressure .
We have this trend to put it in a <unk> .
We hope to be able to do it .
When we get us , we do it with a lot of a lot from the same thing where we put them .
And as I said , I 'm a disaster , I 've got to tell you a disaster , I 've got to be able to be able to be able to be able to put them out of it before .
A lot of women , particularly , and the leaders of the sector , they have afraid of being a lot of being a lot like it .
They have afraid to go back and say , `` Yes , I 'm like , `` Yes , I mean , `` Yes , I 'm a <unk> , '' why it means that tag , why does n't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make them .
Let 's take for example to <unk> , or as I call the call it .
In the last years , it 's a <unk> .
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you 've got in front of the word `` <unk> '' three feet .
It was a great show , you see this star star would be able to be able to know , and to do to know women and men young men who will be a bit of being proud .
I 'll be able to get the time , and the social coordination started arguments , if it was or not the <unk> .
You 'll be able to be able to be able to believe the word of a young woman , and it 's going to get it .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're still fighting for a lot , we want a lot , we need a lot , we need a lot .
We 're going to go much beyond the critical curve and a place , to be able to put the one of any woman , then until you do n't know .
We do n't need to do that .
The bad thing , or more well , a more inclusive , a more inclusive , a bit more inclusive .
But what ?
We 're going to recognize our ones to give you , go to the action and be a little bit more .
If I hear music music , I 'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you
These artists do n't change their way to talk about women in their songs until they 're able to be able to be able to be able to get their value .
It 's not hard .
Why do you have their music to be so <unk> ?
It 's hard to choose something better , and so easy to create a worst choice .
But when the bad decisions are all about this makes more hard to women , the equality that all of us and it 's our responsibility .
I think in my wallet , three and four years .
They are two girls , and so brilliant , and also , and also , I want to go in a world .
And where you 're going to try for the strong creatures that are .
I think in them , a sudden , the best option are known as something more easy to do .
We all can take better decisions .
We can change the bottom when a television program is to the sexual violence against women , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
We can change the <unk> of radio when we heard the children who are trying to women as anything .
We can spend our money to go to the film in another part when the movies do n't try to women , more than these objects .
We can stop to support the mountains where the children are trying to their colleagues as they go back .
In any case , men , these men , especially men , ladies can say , `` No , I 'm not going to go back in his magazine , participate in their project , or work with you , until they do n't give you a number of women .
I 'm not going to work with you , until you get their paper , or their organization is more inclusive with a more specific range of people . ''
You know , they 're <unk> , but I came to participate in this kind of projects , we can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the imagination to the imagination of a decision .
We do n't know <unk> , but not these efforts , without the efforts , and we 're not looking at these things , we 're going to mean very little .
We can make these little acts of courage and wait that our decisions are going to the top , to the people in the power , to the people in the power of film and death of film and music and music , and they get it up , the people who can make big decisions , more vulnerable , to create a change change , more vulnerable .
We can also tell you with our own , good , bad , or whatever .
The last line of my book `` <unk> <unk> , '' says , `` You 'll be a bad thing to not be in all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons , but I say , about everything , because there 's my voice , because there 's my voice to me .
There was a mountains .
I call it mountains to do in front of what happened .
A lot of young boys , I did n't know that the kids can do this one girl .
I wanted me as if it was nothing .
I started believe that it was n't anything .
<unk> my voice , and after everything I 'm not going to believe that I could say something that might say something that might say .
But I was writing .
And I came to <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> version of me .
And the words of those women who could understand a story like mine , and of the women who was inspired to me and share what I would live in this world if you have the brown skin .
And the words of women who showed me it was not nothing .
I learned like it , and then I learned to write like me .
I found my voice again , and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure .
On the writing of writing , I also found that if it was a little bit , another woman could hear and see , and I realize that none of us is the thing that the world is to tell you that we are .
In a hand , I have the power to do anything .
And in the other , I think the fact that I 'm only a woman .
I 'm a bad one , I 'm a good woman , I 'm trying to improve my way to think , what I say , and what I do , I do n't know everything that makes me human .
I hope we all can do the same .
I hope that we had all to be a little bit , when you need to be a little bit , when you need to be a little bit .
Now , after three year last year , <unk> children in California , they were supposed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be sitting there .
The virus then went back to the border with Canada , we 're going to go back to 100 children in <unk> .
One of the <unk> things of this epidemic is that it can be a <unk> for a child with a <unk> system , it 's one of the most sophisticated disease in the world .
There 's a effective vaccine against this from the more <unk> vaccine , but a lot of the children in the mountains were n't done because their parents were afraid , because their parents were afraid of something even worse .
But a moment , it was n't the article that goes up on autism , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to be able to be a signal for the Nobel Street ?
You do n't think most smart scientists that the theory of politicians are autism is a skull ?
I think most of you . It knows , but millions of parents in all the world , they 're going to try to put them in the world , they do n't try to put them to their children to have autism .
Why ?
Here 's why .
This is a graph of the climate increase in the time .
For the most part of the 20th century , the autism was a very sophisticated disease .
Now , the few psychologists and gentlemen that I had heard of it to develop all their life life without seeing a single case .
Now , for decades , the <unk> of GDP came up as only three or four children for every 10 .
But then , in the 1970s , the numbers started <unk> .
<unk> of them as <unk> <unk> , you know the autism as a epidemic as a epidemic , like if I could be a lot of other child in the day .
What 's happening ?
If you 're not the vaccines , what is ?
If you ask the question of the Nobel Center of <unk> , what is happening , they tend to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go back as `` <unk> of the Sahara 's Law . ''
But that 's that kind of language not a lot of the fears of a young mother that can look at the face of his son of two years , the visual contact .
If the police of slavery had to happen , why were the beginning of the beginning ?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1970s ?
five years ago , I decided to discover the answers to these questions .
I learned that what happened has less to see with the slow progress and a little bit of the science that with the <unk> power of the area .
For the most part of the 20th century , the doctors had a story about what the autism is , and how it was discovered , but that story turned to be no , and the consequences of the same are having a impact in public health health .
There was a second story of the autism that had lost and start on the <unk> of the American literature .
This second story tells us everything about how we come here and where we have to go .
And the first story begins with a young child , <unk> <unk> , from the Scotland who was diagnosed .
You can have been seen for hours to the hands of their faces , but they were able to be able to <unk> it by <unk> as when you do n't know their favorite toy in their own place without knowing them .
In the basis of the international patients in their clinic , <unk> <unk> that autism is very exciting .
In the 1970s , as the main authority of the world in the topic in the topic , I realized that there were seen less than 150 , so they had seen less than a real cases of his syndrome as they get it in places .
This actually is not from wonder , because the <unk> of <unk> for the key of autism were very <unk> .
For example , I 'll be able to give that key to young children , but now we know that it 's very common in autism .
One time you 've got to come to nine of every 10 children died by other doctors to be a lot of give you a diagnosis of autism .
<unk> was a smart man , but part of their theories were not <unk> .
<unk> the autism as a kind of young child in parents and <unk> .
These children , he said , they 've got a <unk> in a London who do n't get up .
At the same time , yet , I noticed that some of their young young people had a special skills that we 've got in certain areas like the music , mathematics and memory .
One of the children in their clinic could teach it between 18 , before the two years ago .
When his mother put one of their favorites , he said , `` Copenhagen . ''
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills , let 's ask things like the children were just done what they had heard their parents <unk> , so so they 've heard their parents .
As a result , the autism became a source of shame for the families , and two generations of young children were taken to institutions for their own right , it becomes good for the world .
Man , I was not to the 1970s , which researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that the autism was amazing .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , I thought that the theory of the mothers <unk> from <unk> was pretty serious .
She and her husband John were <unk> and <unk> , and they had a big daughter called pencil .
<unk> and John knew I was going to take a child as he was going to take a child , without education education , and without access to other resources without a diagnosis .
To take it in the National <unk> <unk> , that they needed more resources for children and their families , <unk> and his colleague , <unk> and her colleague , decided to do something that should have made 30 years earlier .
They 've got a study of autism in the general population .
<unk> one of London called <unk> to try to find the young children in the community .
So what you saw , that the model of <unk> was too limited , because the reality of autism was a lot more low and open .
Some children could n't talk about all , while each other were <unk> in their vote for the <unk> , in the dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk> .
On the other way , these kids do n't get in <unk> and <unk> , like he said , and you saw a lot of them , much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would be suggesting .
At the beginning , they were going to try to give sense to their data .
How do you do n't come from these children before ?
But then , I found a way to a article in a article found in 1984 , the next year to the article of <unk> , and then then I forgot , he turned up under the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember .
And I knew about this article of the competition , but I 'm going to be able to be able to put it back to <unk> in their own work .
I did n't even do n't even a translation to the English , but by lucky , the husband of <unk> talked about a German book , and he made it for it .
You have a lot of a alternative story of autism .
His band was a man called Hans uncle , which was born a <unk> clinic with a school school in India in the 1970s .
And the ideas of the uncle for the children of children with learning , they were <unk> even for the grandchildren .
The morning in his clinic started with music with music with music , and the children would get their games at the afternoon .
In place , in place to the parents of autism , which shows the <unk> as a <unk> disability of life , and spaces in the course of the life of all life .
In place to try to the children in their clinic as patients , which was called his little teachers , and they were asked to help in the development of education , who were especially right for them .
You know , she saw the autism as a <unk> , which was a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is a very low variety of writing and disability .
He believed that the autism , and they 've always seen it , and they always have been a lot of , looking at some of this becomes , look at some of this <unk> , in the <unk> culture as the professor would go .
He was more there even to say , that for the success in science and art , one of autism is essential .
<unk> , I found that <unk> was wrong in which the autism was <unk> , so as the parents were the day .
In the next few years , they worked in silence with the American American American American American Association to create the diversity of what he called `` spectrum spectrum . ''
On the end of the '80s , and the principles of the 90 , their changes in places , and then the <unk> model of <unk> by the <unk> of a little bit of the <unk> .
These changes was not taken up in my wife .
You know , when <unk> , and we were born , and we were born between me to treat these streets , people from all the world look at the world look at a long time .
Before , I came out , `` Grand Street , '' just a little circle , <unk> by experts knew what the autism was the autism , but after the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and then after the <unk> <unk> , and then after the <unk> <unk> .
At the same time , they brought the first clinical trials to use for the autism .
I did n't have to have a connection with the small circle of experts to make a diagnosis for their son .
And the combination of `` Grand Stewart '' the changes in the streets and the introduction of these evidence created a effect of network , a perfect force of the urban consciousness .
The <unk> number started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> , and unfortunately , in fact , we were able to try that the people with autism , and their families finally get the support and the services they were born .
So I was born <unk> came to the vaccines in the <unk> , a simple , powerful story , and the very powerful story like the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk> .
If the <unk> of the center that one of the center of the center that one of every percent children in the U.S. they are in the spectrum , it 's right , you are one of the biggest groups of the world .
In the last years , people have come up in the Internet to give you the idea of the idea that they 're going to solve through the new experiments , <unk> the term `` <unk> '' to celebrate the kinds of human nature .
A way to understand the <unk> is thinking in terms of human systems .
The fact that you do n't work with me , it does n't mean that it 's broken .
According to the dark , the human human brain is easily easily .
Now , unfortunately , people do you have to live in a world not built for them .
70 years later , we 're still going to paint , which shows that the `` cure '' for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of the teachers , and the parents with support , communities , communities with faith .
A little woman called <unk> <unk> said , `` We need all the hands in the United States to <unk> the boat of humanity . ''
While we start into a human future , we need all the human forms in the planet to do in the planet to make the challenges that we face as society .
We ca n't be able to determine a brain .
Thank you .
