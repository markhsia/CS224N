You know what I do is write for children , and , in fact , I 'm probably the author for children , more read in the United States .
And I always tell people that I do n't want to seem like a scientist .
I can play as a farmer , or with leather , and never no one has chosen a farmer .
I 'm here to talk to you about circles and greatness .
And you know that a little bit of them is not something that you fell somewhere .
You just have to give the apple to see it as a hope .
That 's the picture of a circle .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> .
It 's the kind of complicated circle that I 'm going to talk about .
My circle started in the middle school , in <unk> , Ohio where I was the weird class .
When I put it up to support every week in the bathroom , until a teacher saved me life .
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom room .
I did it in secret .
For three years .
I had to go from the city .
He had a thumb , and 85 dollars , and I ended up in San Francisco , California -- I found a lover -- and in the '80s , I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS .
About three or four years ago , half of the night , I received a phone call of that teacher , the <unk> lady who said , `` I need to see you .
I 'm a lot of adults we never get to know .
You could <unk> the Ohio , and please bring that man that I know you 've already found .
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer cancer , and I 'd like you to do you with this please . ''
Well , the next day we were in Cleveland .
We went to see , we laugh , we know , and we realized that she needed to be <unk> .
We find a place , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and we 're going to take them out of his family , because it was necessary .
It 's something we knew how to do .
And so as the woman I wanted to do is , as an adult arrived , became a box of <unk> , and it was put on my hands .
And what happened was that the circle had been closed , it had become a circle -- and that hope that I talked about was done in itself .
That 's that death is part of life .
She saved my life , my partner and I save her .
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life .
It needs true and beauty , and I 'm very happy that I talked about a lot of this .
It also needs -- needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it 's our work to provide those things .
Thank you .
As an artist , the connection is very important for me .
Through my work , I 'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected .
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years , and there I saw my first lot .
I was my mind .
My heart can fast , I was <unk> , trying to understand what I was in front of me .
They 're going to kill me about <unk> of the water almost 60 feet , and I could n't more than I think it was about a bit of snow , like year after year .
They 're born when they 're coming out of the glaciers , or you break the ice booms .
Each iceberg has their own individual personality .
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences .
Some of you will have to give them up and hold them down to the end , whereas others ca n't stop and <unk> in a foreign passion .
It 's easy to think , when you see a iceberg , which are separated and alone , in a great measure as humans .
But the reality is all the opposite .
As there was a iceberg , I 'm going to breathe its primitive atmosphere .
As there 's a iceberg , it gets rich fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life .
I 'm going to photograph these <unk> as if it was treated by the portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these unique moments of that way , and it 's not going to be on that way again .
It 's not death when it goes down ; it 's not a end , but one next one of his way for the cycle of life .
Part of the ice 's ice that I 'm trying to be very young -- it has a couple of years ago .
And another part of the ice has more than 100 thousand years .
The last photos I 'd like to show you is a iceberg that photographed in <unk> , Greenland .
It 's a little bit of going to be able to witness a platform .
Here you have .
You can see the left a little boat .
It 's about five feet .
And I 'd like to pay attention to the way of the iceberg and its <unk> line .
You can see here , it starts to roll , the boat has moved to the other hand and the man is there .
This is a metaphor of Greenland , from average size .
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet .
This video is in real time .
And so , it shows a different side of its personality .
Thank you .
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979 , the same day , exactly at the same moment , every single baby . Okay .
So , two couples every one of a baby .
I do n't want to be able to stop the details of conception , because if you stop thinking about conception , I 'm not going to pay attention .
Let 's think about that for a moment .
And on this stage , I want you to imagine that , in a case , the chromosome and the sperm comes into the X X of the egg .
And , in the other case , the X X of the sperm joined the X X of the egg .
They both turn up and start the life .
We 're going to talk about them later .
In my land activity to get two roles .
In one of my roles , I work with the history of the anatomy .
I 'm an formation of formation , and what I study in this case is the way people looked at the anatomy , and they 're going to say , of human bodies and <unk> , how you 've considered the body fluids , the idea of the body , what have thought about the body .
The other role that performance in my work is the activist , as a patient 's patients or , as I say , <unk> people who are doctors .
In this case , I 've been working with people whose physical features to challenge social norms .
I 've been working for example , for example , with identical twins , two people inside a body .
I 've been working with people with <unk> -- people much more low than the average .
And I 've been working with many cases of people with reductionist sex , individuals whose physical tensions did n't fit into male and conventional women .
In general lines , we can call it <unk> .
The <unk> takes a lot of ways .
I 'm going to give them some examples of ways to have a sex that does n't get to <unk> in male and female forms .
So for example , it 's the case of the individual <unk> , which is the <unk> gene of the chromosome and says to the <unk> , that we all have in the observable life , that 's going to get testicles .
And then , in the observable life , the testicles produce testosterone .
But because this individual lacks testosterone of testosterone , the body does n't respond to the same .
It 's the <unk> syndrome .
So , there are high levels of testosterone , but no reaction .
As a consequence , the body moves to a female course .
When you 're born , the baby is like a child .
It 's a child . It 's a little bit like a child .
And , often , it 's not not until puberty , when it 's growing and developing the breast , but it does n't have the menstrual period , when somebody realizes that something is going on .
Then of doing tests , they realize that instead of being ovaries and Muslim , actually has testicles and a chromosome .
The important thing to understand is that you can think it 's about a man , but it 's actually not that .
Women , like the men , we have in the body something called <unk> glands .
They 're in the back of the body .
<unk> glands produce <unk> , the hormone <unk> .
Most women like me -- I think I consider a typical woman ; I do n't know its <unk> structure ; I think it 's a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to <unk> .
We have <unk> and respond to the <unk> .
As a consequence , somebody like me have the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has the <unk> syndrome to the <unk> .
So sex is something complicated . It 's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a certain way you can be everywhere .
Another example , a few years ago , I received a call from a 19th year-old guy born and raised as a kid ; he had girlfriend , and sex with her , was a life like a kid , and I 'd just discover that I had ovaries and uterus .
I had a extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There was 20th chromosomes , and in the States , <unk> glands were so active that , essentially , created a male hormone environment .
As a consequence , their genitals were <unk> , his brain was exposed to the Social hormone component .
He was born with a child , no one hit anything .
And it was the 19 years when he started to have medical problems caused by the inner 1980s , when doctors found that , in fact , it was a woman for inside .
Well , another quick example of <unk> .
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what 's known as <unk> , it 's <unk> <unk> tissue in tissue tissue .
We do n't know why that happens .
So , there are lots of sex .
The reason for the reason we children with this kind of body bodies , identical twins , or <unk> , or <unk> in surgery , is not to be able to have a better physical health .
In many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
The reason why they go through several surgeries is that they 're a threat for our social categories .
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity .
We have the idea that I 'm going to be female identity ; it was supposed to be black .
It 's an simplistic idea .
And when it looks like a body that shows something pretty different , we have problems with <unk> .
So we have a very ambitious ideas in our culture of our culture .
Our nation is based on a concept of a very romantic .
Imagine the amazing thing that we 're born as two people in the same body .
The recent case is last year in the past year , <unk> <unk> <unk> ; they put his sex into the <unk> Olympics .
Many journalists were called to say , `` What 's a test you 're going to do to determine if <unk> <unk> is man or woman ? ''
And I had to tell the journalists that there is no test .
In fact , we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature does n't take a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> ; we are all of those who we 've seen that line .
So , what we have is a situation where the most <unk> , more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were categories of stable graphics , which would be diagnosed directly with categories .
And not just in terms of sex .
In terms of race , something that is much more complicated than the terminology allows .
So , as we see , we go into a dry terrain .
Let 's look for , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA .
What would you think about the fact of them in just a few thirds ?
And as we can be stored in science , we get more and more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize the categories that <unk> are probably too excited .
And we 're looking at this in all the life of human life .
One of them , for example , in our current culture , in the United States today , are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life .
It 's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and have different rights to the <unk> .
There 's very <unk> today today <unk> not in public , but I know inside the <unk> of it , when someone is considered dead .
We never had to deal with this question of whether somebody was dead .
As a lot of him would put a little bit of his nose in front of your nose , and if it was still not <unk> .
If I stopped moving the <unk> .
But today we can , for example , extract a vital organ of a body and put them into another body .
And , as a consequence , we have to deal with the dilemma of determine really the dilemma of somebody 's death , and this is put us into a difficult situation that we do n't have the simple categories of the past .
And perhaps think that this explosion of categories could make someone like me .
In politics , I 'm an electrode , I invite people to people with unusual bodies , but I have to admit that me to give me nervous .
You know , these categories are much more fragile than we thought about .
<unk> from the point of view of democracy .
And to tell you about this tension first , I have to admit that I 'm a little bit of <unk> of the father .
I know they were racist , I know they were <unk> , but they were great .
I mean , they were so brave and audacious and so radical what they did , I find every little bit of that <unk> <unk> , and not for the music , which is completely <unk> .
It 's why it happened to him , in 1919 to forget .
You know , the first activists were , for me , the first activists of anatomy and explain why .
What they did n't was a whole concept , and it <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and kept left for 200 years .
And , as all of you remember , what did n't remember our father 's idea was the idea of the monarchy . The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the anatomy .
You know , they were n't known the DNA , but they had clear the idea of birth .
They had the concept of blue blood .
It 's about the idea that they came to the political power for the right of the blood of a father , and then the child , etc .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the idea of a new concept , and that concept was that all men are created the same .
They put the field of play , and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences of anatomy . That was something very radical .
And in part of what they were doing because it 's a part of a <unk> system where they were stored two things .
It was a democracy , and at the same time in the same time and the same time in the same time .
And it 's very clear , if you look at the history of the previous father , that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world .
They were <unk> out of the acoustic explanations and so they made the concept of the power of power , it 's going to be a Hindu idea of birth .
They were moving into a vision concept .
And if you look at , for example , the Universal Declaration of anger , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
Do n't talk about God and nature 's nature .
They talk about power of nature to tell us who we are .
And in a consequence , they were spreading the idea of the wild coincidence .
And , by doing it , they were the foundations of the future Rights movement .
They did n't think about that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
And what happened years later ?
And women succeeded .
Then , the success of the Civil Rights movement with people of <unk> <unk> , who said , `` I 'm not a woman ? ''
We found men in the U.S. Rights movement saying , `` I 'm a man . ''
So again , people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the raw difference on the wild difference and , again , succeeded .
We see the same thing with the Civil Movement .
The problem is , of course , that as we look at the pore , we have to start asking questions why we keep certain divisions .
But , attention , I want to keep some sides of us in our culture .
For example , I do n't want to give a fish for the same rights that a human .
I do n't want to say that we had to be <unk> to the anatomy .
I do n't want to say that at the age of five years , they had to be able to have sex or married .
There are a few ways that for me have sense , and I think we should keep .
But the challenge is to try to discover what they 're , why do you have sense .
Well , let 's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk .
We have two beings , both <unk> at the same day .
So let 's imagine that one of them , Mary , was born three months before time .
Henry , in the contrary , it was born in the term : he was born .
For the only fact , I 've been born three months before Mary was inspired all the rights three months before Henry -- it 's right to the sexual consent , the right to vote , the right to <unk> .
Henry has to wait for all that , not because I have a different biological age , but because he was born .
We found other entries in relationship to their rights .
So Henry , at virtue of being considered man , and I have n't told you if it 's <unk> , at virtue of being considered <unk> , right now that Mary does n't have to worry about .
Mary , for his part , it does n't have the same rights to the marriage that Henry in all states , for example .
He can get married in all the states with a woman , Mary can married a woman just in some states .
So still interfere categories that in various ways are and questionable .
And now the question is , what do we do now that science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be done ?
I do n't want to give science , but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to us .
Where are we ?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude , `` Well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we 're going to do . ''
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position .
For example , Texas in a moment has decided that to get married with a man , there 's no one that I have to have chromosome and to get married with a woman , you have to have chromosome .
Now , in practice , they do n't do a regular tests .
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome .
If you look at one of the founders of the founders of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , in his speech , `` I 'm going to give you a solution .
He says that we should judge people `` based on your skin , but in the content of its character , '' going beyond the anatomy .
And I mean , `` Yes , the idea seems very good . ''
But in practice , how do you do ?
How do they judge people on the content of its character ?
I want to point , also I 'm not sure that we had to be <unk> in this for <unk> rights to people , because I admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services that some human services I know .
I also want to say , maybe some of them have to say , maybe a little bit of <unk> , you know , you can take more successful decisions , smart and <unk> on their sex relations that people have to have to know .
So , how to put in practice the subject of character of character ?
It 's very difficult .
And one part of me , what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument , perhaps with an fMRI resonance .
We want to really get to that point ?
I 'm not sure where we go .
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to take this current in the way of the democracy .
We 've made a good job in defense for democracy , and I think we 'll make a good job in the future .
We do n't live , for example , in a context like the Iranian , that a man who feels attracted for other men , it 's going to be killed , unless it 's willing to be willing to be willing to a sex change , in which case it 's allowed to live .
We 're not in that situation .
I 'm glad to say that we do n't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago , and then they get their fame .
But when the phone asked the reason the reason I asked a very <unk> operation , I told me that in that other country , these kids would be very abused and so I had to do it .
And I said , `` Well , it 's considered the political age in time of the surgical separation ? ''
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who they 're without <unk> to change the way of the state .
So I think we have to be the head .
Well , to end , I want to say that I 've been talking about a lot of the tears .
And I want to think about how democracy would be , or as I could have a lot of participation to <unk> .
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and it 's that I think you can have different ideas from different kinds of different anatomy , particularly if there are people thinking about .
Since years ago , because I 've been interested in the <unk> , I 've also been interested in investigate the sexual difference .
And one of the things that has been interested in the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operate in the world .
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women , in average , not all , but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to the complex social relations , and to deal with those who are <unk> inside the group .
And , if we think about that , we have a interesting situation in our hands .
And years ago , when I was in graduate school , one of my troops who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> , like <unk> made me a strange thing .
`` Tell me what 's about Congress . ''
And I thought , `` Is the most silly question I 've heard .
Feminism has to look at all the stereotypes of gender stereotypes , so there 's no female music .
But the more I 've thought about their question , more I 've thought about the question , and it 's a little bit of foreign .
I mean , that could be something , in average , something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social relations and willing to help the most vulnerable .
So , if they were very open , they were very open to find the way to protect people out of the state , it 's possible that , that we have to get more <unk> to this concept , perhaps we would have been taken the concept of protection with the support support .
And maybe that 's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond the anatomy of anatomy : think about the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more in relations .
So , as we try to create a more perfect approach , let 's think about what we do about each other .
Thank you .
In the year , I decided we had to deny how we think about economic development .
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work , have the ability to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new residents .
Well , at this moment , we 're far away from that goal .
There are billions of people in developing countries that do n't tell a single city of <unk> .
But the amazing thing about the cities is that it 's worth more than the cost of construction .
So we can easily give up the world tens , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
Well , this can sound absurd if you 've never thought about new cities .
But just <unk> by buildings .
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in the apartments , they were owners and that the other half to the other half , you 're going to be able to do it .
They could try to increase the ability to do it in all the existing buildings .
But you know that the problem is that those buildings and the areas that around us have rules to avoid the bones and the algorithms of construction .
So it would be very difficult to do all of those .
But they could go to a whole place , building a whole building building , always , and when the rules of that place we 're going to get building the construction instead of the construction instead of the construction .
So I proposed that governments are going to put up new areas of work for great enough , and I gave them a name : developing cities .
Later , I learned that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras .
They knew that every year about 75 <unk> of his country to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask asking what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras .
In the summer of 2009 , Burma of a <unk> crisis .
In the next regular choices , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and the same time .
He asked him that it was his boss .
Meanwhile , I was preparing to give a talk to TEDGlobal .
Through a whole process , trial and error , and a great amount of tests with users , tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities to their most essential ideas .
The first point was the importance of the norms , like those norms that they say that you ca n't go and kill all the current residents .
It would be a lot of attention to new technologies , but it 's need so much of technologies as a norms for progress , and usually they are the norms that we 're going to be going to move forward .
In the fall of 2010 , a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the TEDTalk .
He showed it to <unk> .
They called me .
They said , `` Let 's put this to the leaders of our country . ''
So in December , we met in Miami , in a hotel room .
I tried to tell you this point about how valuable cities are , much more valuable than its average cost .
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York , look at it , in some cases , it 's worth billions per square meter .
But it was a pretty abstract argument , and at some time , when there was a break , <unk> said , `` Paul , maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk TEDTalk . ''
And the talk I described in a very simple city that a low city is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain , a charter that specifies the rules that are going to be there and a choice for people that people can choose if they want to go or not live under those norms .
So the president of Honduras called me , and he told me that we had to do this project , this is important , this could be the way that our new country .
He asked me to be <unk> and talk about new and five of January .
So I presented another talk full of data , which included an image like this , which was trying to explain that for a lot of value to a city , this has to be very big .
This is a picture of Denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver .
Only this airport covers over 100 kilometers .
So , I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a place that 's going to take on less than 1,000 kilometers .
That 's more than 100,000 acres .
All the world 's <unk> .
The faces of the audience were very serious and open .
The leader of the conference came up to the platform and said , `` Professor <unk> , thank you so much for his talk , but maybe we could see the video of the Talk TEDTalk .
I have here in my computer . ''
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk .
And this explained the essential -- that a new city can provide new choices for people .
It would have a choice of a city that you could go in Honduras , instead of hundreds of kilometers away to North .
And they also would have new choices for the leaders .
Because the leaders of the government 's government , they need to benefit from developing countries associated , could benefit from the developing countries that will help them establish and make the norms of the charter , so that everyone could rely on that the charter .
We went and we saw a place .
This picture is there .
I could cover it .
And a little bit later , the 19 of January , they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and adding a constitutional asset that could create these special regions of development .
In a country that I had just been going through this painful crisis , the voting in Congress to go from this constitutional tempting was to <unk> one .
All of the parties , all of them did in society , the little bit .
To <unk> in the Constitution , you have to spend two times in Congress .
The 17 of February came over again in another voting , to one .
Immediately after the voting , from 21 to 24 of February , a lot of 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities .
One of them is North Korea .
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in North Korea ; it 's bigger than the center of Boston .
All you see there was built in four years , after I spent four years to get them .
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore .
In fact , they have two cities in China , and they 're preparing for a third .
And if you think about this very practical , this is the point where we are .
They have a place , and they 're already thinking about a place for the second city .
They 're making a legal system that would allow you to be able to be able to operate under a external legal system .
A country , it 's already committed to allow his Supreme Court to allow this new Supreme system for this new system .
There are <unk> and <unk> , which are very interested in the project .
You can even get a little bit of funding .
But the only thing we know that they have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants .
There are a lot of companies that wanted to move in the Americas , especially in a place with a free area , and there 's a lot of people who would like to go to live there .
In the world there are 700 million people who say they 'd like to change immediately another place .
There 's a million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States .
Many of them are parents who have to stop his family to go to get a job ; sometimes they have the money that they have to earn money to be just eating or buy clothes .
Unfortunately , sometimes , even children who are trying to meet their parents who have n't seen , in a decade .
So what seems to think about building a new city in Honduras ?
Or build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these around the world ?
What seems to you think of them to think that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
This is an idea worth spreading .
And my friends <unk> asked me to say , `` Thank you TED . ''
I 'm <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
But before you show you what there is inside , I 'm going to make a public confession , and it 's , I live obsessed with the suits .
I love to find , let 's put them , and more recently , photograph and publish me on my blog , etc. , colorful and different for every single time .
But I do n't buy anything new .
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and shops of second .
Ah , thank you .
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet .
I 'm going to know people <unk> , for all my money is going to a good cause , and I can buy it becomes my personal pursuit of treasures .
I mean , what will I find today ?
Is it going to be my size ?
Would you like the color ?
Is it less than 20 dollars ?
If all the answers are positive , so I feel that I 've won .
So I want to tell the subject of my <unk> , I want to tell you what they 're going to do for this exciting week at TED .
I mean , what do you get somebody who 's got all that clothing ?
So I 'm going to show you exactly what I bought .
I 've brought seven pairs of feet inside , and nothing else .
It 's inside a week is all I 've been in my <unk> .
I figured out that it would be able to find everything else that I wanted to use after coming here to Springs Springs .
And because I do n't know as the woman who walks for TED in the inside , that means I found some things .
And I 'd like to show you now the sets for this week .
Does n't sound interesting ?
While I do , I 'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that , believe or not , I 've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing .
Let 's start with Sunday .
This is a brilliant tiger .
You do n't have to spend a lot of money to see it well .
You know , you can always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars .
All of the whole set , including the jacket , 55 55 , and it 's the most expensive I 've used in the week .
Monday : The color is energy .
It 's almost impossible to be impossible , when you 're wearing a brilliant red pants .
If you 're happy , you 're going to attract other happy people .
Boy : The integration is <unk> .
I 've spent a long time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk> .
I just know yourself .
If you 're going to tell you about the right people , not just to understand it , they 're also going to be <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> of the child you 're wearing inside .
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> , or I remember his little <unk> .
I like <unk> and say , `` Thank you . ''
Now , the confidence is the key .
If you think you think you 're good with something , it 's almost sure you 're .
And if you think you do n't do well with something , it 's probably true .
My mother taught me this day after day .
But it was n't until 30 years that really understood its meaning .
And I 'm going to explain in a few seconds .
If you think you 're a beautiful person in your interior and outside , there 's no look that you ca n't attract .
So there 's no excuse for anyone in this audience .
We must be able to do everything we want to do .
Thank you .
<unk> : Well , it 's a little bit of six words for you , <unk> <unk> .
And finally , Saturday : It 's a great way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word .
I 've been tested again and again when people get a week , just because I was using , and we had fantastic conversations .
Obviously , everything is not going to go into my little <unk> .
So before I went home , to Brooklyn , I 'm going to give everything .
Because the lesson I 'm trying to learn this week to be able to stop certain things .
I do n't need to be unhappy to these things , because around the corner of the corner , there 's always a crazy suit , a crazy and brilliant <unk> , if there 's a little bit of love in my heart and I 'm looking at .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts .
The left side , which is the right part , and the right side , which is the intuitive part .
So , if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each brain , we could design a flat of our brain .
For example , this would be somebody who 's completely logical .
This would be somebody who 's totally intuitive .
So , where is your brain in this scale ?
Some <unk> for one of these right now , but I think that for most of the city of the audience in this audience , your brain is something like this -- with a great tool in the same time .
It 's not going to be another exclusive .
You can be logical and intuitive .
I consider me one of those people , that the same most of the other quantum physical physicists , we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas .
But at the same time , we need pretty intuition to make the experiments really work .
How do we develop this intuition ? Well , we like to play with things .
We put them to play with them , and then we see our intuition from that point .
And actually , you do the same thing .
It 's a lot of intuition that you can have developed with the end of the years that says that one thing can be only in a place at the time .
I mean , it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you were n't born with this notion , the developed .
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar .
It was a small child , and I did n't do it very well , always .
But I bet you 're going to play with that bar of a parking lot , taught a lesson , and it 's that the big things do n't allow the <unk> , and that 's going into a place .
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world , except you 're a physical physicist .
It would be a terrible model for a physical physicist , because they do n't play with a parking lot , play with these strange particles .
And when they play with their particles , they discover that they do all kinds of things -- as they can go through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
And then they wrote all these observations , and it was called theory of quantum mechanics .
In that point , the physics of the physical mechanics , you need to describe the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles .
But not the needed to describe the big objects around us every day .
That does n't fit very well to my intuition , and maybe it 's not because it 's not very often with particles .
Well , sometimes play with them , but not a lot .
And I 've never seen it .
I mean , no one saw a particle .
But it 's not going to fit it right to my logical part .
Because if it 's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics , then should n't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics ?
I do n't find the reason why it should n't .
And so I would feel a lot better if I could have a common object , also the principles of quantum mechanics .
That 's why a few years ago , I proposed to do exactly that .
And I did .
This is the first object that you can see that it 's been in an image of quantum mechanics .
What we see here is a little computer chip .
And you can try to see the green point right on the middle .
That 's the piece of metal that I 'm going to talk about in a minute .
This is a picture of the object .
And here I 'm going to expand a little bit . It 's just in the center .
And then there 's a good good way on the small <unk> of metal .
What we see is a little bit of metal , with a way of sandstone , and that <unk> in a platform .
And then I did this almost about the same way you do a computer chip .
I went to a clean room with a new chip , and I put all the big machines around 100 hours .
For the last material , I had to build my own machine -- to do this guy with a way of <unk> swimming on the device .
This device has the ability to be in an quantum , but for it needs a little bit of help .
Let me make a analogy .
You know the awkward thing that it 's going to be in a elevator .
I mean , when I 'm in a elevator . I do all kinds of weird things , but then when other people come up , let me do those things , because I do n't want to kill them , or , actually , respected .
Quantum mechanics says that objects behave in the same way .
And they gave them out of <unk> objects that are not only people , it 's also the light that we think about and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room .
And so we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal is <unk> according to quantum mechanics , we would have to bring all the other passengers .
And that 's what we did .
It 's going to get the lights , then we created a password , and we pulled out all the air , and then we put it up to an temperature of less than a degree for zero zero .
Now , when you 're just in the elevator , the little piece of metal is free to act like .
So we measure their movements .
We found that they 're moving in very strange ways .
Instead of being perfectly still , it was vibrating , and the way you 're going to be like a breath of this way -- like a calculators that expands and it takes .
And to give you a soft soft , we were able to make <unk> , and that would n't be <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics .
So what I 'm counting is something really fantastic .
What does it mean that a <unk> thing , and not <unk> at the same time ?
Let 's think about atoms .
In a case , all of the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are really like , and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
It 's just in certain <unk> when those line line .
In the rest of time they 're <unk> .
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , what it means that all the piece of metal is in two different places .
I think this is great .
Really .
It was <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years , because , look at this , the difference in scale between a single atom , and that piece of metal is more or less the same that the difference between that piece of metal and you .
So if one single one can be in two different places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why do n't you ?
I mean , it 's my logical part .
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time , how would that be that ?
How do you use your consciousness if your own body was <unk> in space ?
There 's another part of the story .
And it 's when we understand it , and we turned the lights and look inside the box , we saw that the metal was going on there in a single piece .
And I could come to this new intuition , apparently all the objects in the elevator is actually just a regular objects that are just going to go into a small space .
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics would say that everything is interconnected .
Well , that 's not so true .
It is more profound .
It 's that those connections , your connections to all the things around us , literally define you who you are , and that 's the profound quantum mechanics of quantum mechanics .
Thank you .
My name is <unk> .
And for 18 months ago , I 've been talking about another job in Google , until I proposed the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who was here , and that allowed me to bring it back .
It took me 18 months .
Lots of negotiations and stories , I agree , with 17 museums of nine countries .
But I 'm going to focus on the demo .
There 's a lot of stories why we did .
I think my own story is , I think my own story is just a slide , and this is the access .
I grew up in India .
<unk> of a great education , I do n't have access to a lot of these museums and artwork .
So , when I started traveling and go to museums , I started learning a lot .
And working on Google , I try to do the desire to do it more accessible through technology .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing it .
So let me show you a couple of interesting things that we 've taken out of their launch .
So , just , we 're going to <unk> .
Look around all the museums there are .
It 's the <unk> gallery , the MoMA , the <unk> , <unk> .
In fact , I 'm going to go into one of my favorites , the <unk> museum in New York .
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple .
So , <unk> , we 're in the museum .
No matter where they 're , Bombay or <unk> , that does n't matter .
You 're moving out there , and they have fun .
Would you want to navigate the museum ?
We open the flat flat , and , with a click , we walked inside .
They 're inside , you want to go at the end of the hallway .
He 's going to go ahead . That 's <unk> !
<unk> .
Thank you , I did n't get to the best .
Now I 'm in front of my favorite paintings , `` <unk> '' <unk> <unk> .
So I see the sign sign .
If the museum shows us the image , we can click there .
Look , this is one of the images .
Here 's all the information of it .
For those of you who are really interested in art , you can click there , but I 'm going to click here right now .
And this is one of the images that we 've captured in what we call the <unk> technology .
So this image , for example , contains , I think , about 10,000 million .
And there are a lot of people who ask me , `` What do you get with 10,000 million ? ''
So I 'm going to show you what it really gets to do with 10,000 million .
It can do a very simple way .
You look at fun things that are happening .
I love this kid , his expression has no price .
But if I really wanted to go into .
So I started playing , and I found myself with something that happened there .
And I said , `` A moment , this seems interesting . ''
I went and found that kids were actually playing something .
I did a little bit , I talked to some people of the <unk> , and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> , which is called a <unk> of <unk> with a stick .
And apparently it was very popular .
I do n't know why they did , but I 've learned something about it .
And now we 're going to get even more deep and you 'll see that you can actually get to the cracks .
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective , I 'm going to take a little bit of the image , so you 'll see really what there is .
Here we were , and this is the painting .
The best is to come , a second .
So now we 're going to jump again to the MoMA in New York .
Here 's another one of my favorites , `` The night <unk> . ''
The example I showed was to find details .
But what happens if you want to see the <unk> ?
And if you want to see how often it happened this masterpiece ?
It goes up and really do it .
I 'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture , and I really go to the cracks .
This is `` night <unk> , '' I think I 'd never seen that before .
I 'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions .
There are a lot more things here , but I do n't have time to show .
This is the really cool part . It 's called `` <unk> . ''
All of you , absolutely everything , it does n't matter if it 's rich or poor , or if you have a mansion , that day .
You can be able to create their own museum , create their own collection of all these images .
It 's very simple , we walked , and I 've created this function that I call `` The power of the slums , '' -- we just do a position around .
It 's about `` <unk> '' in the National Gallery of London .
You can write things , they send your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at looking at these male works .
So in conclusion , I think , for me , the main thing is that all amazing things do n't come from Google .
No , in my mind , even they did n't come from the museums .
Maybe I should n't say this .
Actually , come from those artists .
And that 's been my humble experience with this .
I mean , I hope that in this digital medium do justice to their artwork , and it 's represented properly properly .
And the great question I do today is , `` You did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum ? ''
And the answer is not .
It 's to <unk> the experience .
And that 's all . Thank you .
Thank you .
Good afternoon everyone .
I have something to show you .
Think that it 's a <unk> .
In our lab we call it sensitive design .
I 'm going to tell you a little bit about this .
If you look at this picture -- I 'm from Italian illness , all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom , but the reason I 'm showing this this is that has happened very interesting in the careers of four one in the last two decades .
A few time , if you wanted to win a career of Stage 1 , I would take a budget and <unk> it to a good pilot and a good car .
And if the car and the pilot was good enough , you did the career .
This is what , in engineering .
It 's essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
Today , what 's interesting is that systems control systems are starting to enter our lives .
Our cities , in the last years , have been covered with networks and electronic .
They 're going back to the free air .
And , as such , they 're starting to answer a different way , and they can be <unk> and <unk> .
We 're going to make the cities , it 's something big .
As a half times , I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet , but they represent 50 percent of the world 's population .
Eighty percent of the energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
If we could do something with the cities , it would be something big .
Instead of the cities , all of these guys , and they 're entering our everyday objects .
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for weekends in MoMA , during the summer .
It 's called `` TED uncle . ''
Well , our objects , the environment , they start telling us .
In a way , it 's like almost all of all the atoms are going to get sensors and actuators .
And that 's changing the interaction that as humans have to be with the outside environment .
In a sense , it 's almost like the old sleep of Michelangelo .
So , you know , when texting the gentleman , he says that at the end of the hammer , and he threw it down to <unk> , actually , you can still see a little bit <unk> , and he said to screaming , `` You know , I 'm going to be <unk> ? ''
Well , for the first time , our environment starts to talk to us .
And I 'm going to show just a few examples , and I 'm going to be able to be able to get the idea of capture the environment and put something .
Let 's start with the detection .
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab .
This was about four years and a half years in Italy .
It was a summer in 2006 .
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup .
Perhaps some of you remember , they have to play Italy and France , and at the end of <unk> gave the <unk> .
And anyway , I won Italy .
Now , let 's see what happened that day looking at the activity on the network .
Here we see the city .
You see the region in the middle and the <unk> River .
It 's the morning , before the game .
The time line is in the top .
On the early afternoon , there are people over here and doing calls , moving .
It starts the game : silence .
<unk> of France . <unk> from Italy .
<unk> , people do a quick call and go to the bathroom .
Secondly . End of time <unk> .
First extra time , a second .
<unk> , and at a moment , the <unk> .
He says Italy .
That night , they all went to the center of the center .
There you see the great peak .
The next day , everyone was in the center of the winner of the winner , and the first minister of then .
And then everyone came down .
You see the image of the place called <unk> , where , from the Italian time , people will be going to be -- it 's a great party , you can see the peak at the end of the day .
This is just an example of how today you can measure the heart of the city in a way that we could n't have to do just a few years ago .
Another quick example of detection : it 's not about people , but what we use and consume it .
Today , we know everything about the rest of our objects .
This is a map that shows all the chips that 's a Mac , how they put it .
But we know very little about where things go .
So in this project , we developed a little bit of little tags to track the garbage in their change .
We start with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle , a little bit more than a year , to tag what they were released ; different kinds of things , as you can see , things that anyway <unk> .
Then we put a little chip , a tag on the garbage , and then we started <unk> .
These are the results .
From Seattle ...
after a week .
With this information , we realized that there are lots of fragments in the system .
We can do the same with less energy .
These are data that before there did n't exist .
They 're going on different things and there 's a lot of transportation .
But the other thing we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we did n't disappear , which is still somewhere on the planet , it 's still somewhere on the planet .
So if the plastic bottle that we took a day still still .
What if we show that to people , then we can make some change change .
That was the reason of the project .
My colleague of MIT , <unk> <unk> , could tell us a lot more about detection and many other things that we can do with that , but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at the beginning , which is put on the environment .
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago .
Everything started with a question of the city of the city , which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water in public spaces , in architecture .
And the question was , how can technology , the new technology , join that ?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT , in a workshop , was : imagine that they have a trunk and valves , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> that you open and closed .
It creates as a curtain of water , with <unk> .
If you fall down , you can write patterns , showing patterns , images , text .
And when you zoom in , the curtain is to open to , as you see in the image .
We introduced this to the <unk> mayor .
He liked a lot .
And they 're going to get a commission to design the building to the entry .
We call it a <unk> .
All the building is made of water .
There 's no doors or windows , but when you 're coming up to you , you can be open for you to happen .
The ceiling is also covered from water .
And if there 's a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , the ceiling .
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears , like in this case .
Those days would always be somebody in the winter , when you go down the roof , somebody who was there and he said , `` Let 's get the building . ''
No , it 's not that they 've gone out , but when you 're low almost all architecture disappears .
Here it is working .
It looks at the people who are going on .
And here I 'm the same trying to do n't put out the sensors that open water .
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors were going to work .
That night was actually even more fun .
All of the kids of <unk> came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit .
It was n't a building that 's going to get to let you go , but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes of water , and you had to jump to them for not getting them .
( Music noise ) And for us that was very interesting because as architects , engineers , we always think about the use that people give our designs .
But then the reality is always unpredictable .
And that 's the beauty of doing things to interact , that people use .
This is a picture of the building with the physical nature , the <unk> of water , and of projections about them .
And this is what led us to think about the next project I 'm going to show you .
Imagine that they could start to fly .
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air , and that every single one had a small <unk> that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space .
This is the video .
Imagine a helicopter , as that we saw before , it moves with others in synchrony .
We could form this cloud .
A kind of flexible screen like this with a regular configuration in two dimensions .
Or normal , but in three dimensions , that what changes is the light , not the position of the wild .
You can play with a different type .
Imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes , in different kinds of resolution .
And then all of that , I could all have a cloud of <unk> in 3D that you can come up , and you see , and see from very different angles .
This is the real <unk> <unk> , going to the bottom to form a <unk> , like before .
When the light turns out , you see this . The same thing we saw before .
Imagine each of them controlled for one person .
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people , the movement of people , etc. , etc .
I want to show you something for the first time .
We 've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world 's best dancers today , the star of the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D , and use it as a entry for the <unk> .
Here we can see <unk> dancing .
On the left , you see the <unk> , the capture in different resolutions .
It 's both 3D digitization as a movement of movement .
It can <unk> all the movement .
You can go all the way .
And once we have the extinct , we can play with them , with the color and the movement , with gravity and rotation .
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk> .
I wanted to show you the last project that we 're working on .
It 's something for the Olympics in London .
It 's called the wing .
And the idea is , imagine again , that we could engage people to do something and change our environment , as a <unk> <unk> , but with a cloud .
Imagine that we could do every little bit of a little bit for a <unk> .
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two decades , we spent the physical world to the digital world .
We know everything , as knowledge , and it 's accessible through the Internet .
Today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign , we can go to the digital world , of the power power of networks , the physical world .
In our case , this can we want to use it to design and make a symbol .
That would be something built in a city .
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today : think about climate change or CO2 emissions , how to happen the digital world to the physical world ?
And the idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together , a collective way .
The cloud is a cloud , again , made from the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles .
And those particles are water , whereas in our cloud are <unk> .
It 's a physical structure in London , but covered in it .
You can move inside , having different experiences .
You can see it from the bottom , to serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more , and it can be used as a way of connection to the community .
So , it 's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can come up , as a new bit of London .
You can get there .
As if it was a new <unk> , a new <unk> in night , but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who go to the top .
Thank you .
Would you like to be better than they 're ?
Suppose I told you that , with just a lot of changes in their genes , they could improve memory -- for more accurate , more accurate and faster .
Or maybe I 'd like to be in the best way , to be more strong , to be more .
Would you like to be more attractive and safe themselves ?
How about living more health ?
Or maybe they 're about those people who always wanted to be more creative .
What 's what I would like ?
What would you like , if you could choose something ?
( Audience member : <unk> .
How many people would make creativity ?
Hands up . Let me see .
A few . There was probably the amount of creative people .
That 's very good .
How many would you take your memory ?
A lot more .
And the physical state ?
A little less .
What about longevity ?
Ah , most of it . That makes me feel very well as a doctor .
If you could have something about this the world would be very different .
Is it just imagination ?
Or maybe possible ?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here in the TED conference , but today I want to give you a doctor 's look at the subject .
The great quarter of the 20th century , <unk> , which also <unk> in the church <unk> <unk> , wrote a essay called `` Nothing in biology has meaning except to the light of Evolution . ''
But if we actually embrace biological evolution consider this : it 's just about the past , or the future ?
Is the other or us ?
This is another look at the tree of life .
The human part of this branch , well in a extreme , it is , of course , the more we 're interested in .
<unk> of a common ancestor for the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years .
In the space , there 's been maybe 20 different species of hominids .
Some have gone and become .
We 've been here about nine years .
I could seem that we 're very far from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same .
Can you realize that we can take up and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetes ?
This is not as a human insulin , but it 's the same protein , <unk> , which is coming out of the pancreas .
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that all of us have in the most bacteria gut that the cells we have in the rest of the body ?
Perhaps 10 times more .
I mean , think about -- when Antonio jumps on the <unk> -- think about bacteria ?
And the gut is a wonderful environment for those bacteria .
It 's warm , dark , colder , it 's very thin .
And we 're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to do without endeavor of their part .
It 's really a quick way for bacteria to be a quick way for the bacteria disruption of some <unk> .
But , for the other , we 're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they 're essential for our life .
They 're going to bring essential nutrients , and protect us from certain diseases .
But what is the future ?
We 're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as species ?
Or meant to become something different , something probably better adapted to the environment ?
In this vast remote symphony of the universe , life on Earth is like a little compass -- the animal kingdom , as a only <unk> , and the human life , a little note of grace .
That was us .
And it was also the whole part of this talk , so I hope you 're going on .
When I was just going to graduate college to college , I had my first class of biology .
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology .
I fell in love with the power of evolution , and I realized something fundamental , in most of the existence of life , in social organisms , every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy energy of that cell is transmitted to two daughters .
But when it looks like the organisms to get things to change .
It 's going to the sexual reproduction .
And something very important , with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
In fact , you could say that the attempt of the death of the body comes in evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction .
I have to argue that when I was a college student thought , well , <unk> , <unk> , death for sex ; it seemed pretty reasonable at that moment , but with every year that happened , every time I had more blame .
I got to understand the feelings of George Burns , which is still performing Vegas right in their 90 years .
And one night , somebody hits his front door .
He opens the door .
In front of him , there 's a little bit of clothes .
He looks like , and he says , `` I came to search for a <unk> soup .
`` It 's good , '' says George , `` I 'm going to make the soup . ''
I realized , as a doctor , who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution , not necessarily counterintuitive , just different .
I was trying to preserve the body .
I wanted to be healthy .
I wanted to get health in the disease .
I wanted to live more and more healthy .
Evolution is going to happen the genome to the next generation , and we 're going to have a generation of generation after generation .
From a certain point of view of mind , you 're like <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden to the next level of the next level , and then let 's go to the sea .
I think we all wanted to understand the feeling that make Woody Allen when he said , `` I do n't want to get immortality through my work .
I want to do it not die . ''
Evolution does n't necessarily ignore longevity .
It 's not necessarily going to get to the bigger or the stronger or the faster or even the more intelligent .
Evolution makes the best creatures to their environment .
That 's the only test of survival and success .
In the bottom of the ocean , the bacteria <unk> that can be able to survive the heat of the <unk> that they 're going to be , if we were fish there , <unk> , yet , they 've managed to do that a radioactive environment .
So , what does this mean , when we look at what 's going on in evolution , and if you go back to think about the place of humans in evolution , and in particular , if you look forward , the next phase -- I would say there 's a lot of possibilities .
The first thing is that we do n't <unk> .
We 've reached a kind of equilibrium .
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine , in the first place , we 've known to preserve a lot of genes that in other ways would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population .
And in the second place , as a species , we 've set up our environment , so that we adapt to us , like we adapt to him .
And , by the way , we assumed , <unk> , and we 're going to get them so much that it 's not possible to have the isolation of evolution .
A second possibility is that you get an evolution of the traditional , natural type of the forces of nature .
And the argument here would be : that the gears of evolution would pay slow , but they 're <unk> .
And in terms of isolation , when a kind of <unk> planets are going to be isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution of natural way .
But there 's a third possibility , an important possibility , intriguing and terrifying .
And I call it <unk> , the new evolution , which is not just natural -- but we 're going to be able to benefit and benefit by us as individuals in the decisions we 're going to be .
Now , how could this happen ?
How could we get to do this ?
First consider the reality that many people today , in some cultures , are taking decisions about their offspring .
In some cultures , they 're choosing to have more males women .
It 's not something good for the society , but it 's what you choose to the individual level and family .
Think that if it could be possible , we could not just have the sex of their offspring , but in its own body to do genetic muscles to cure or prevent diseases .
And if we could do the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer 's or reducing the risk of cancer or remove the stroke ?
Do n't want to do those changes in their genes ?
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more likely .
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and 13 years ago .
<unk> <unk> million dollars .
The next year I have done , in 2004 , I could do the same work for 20 million months .
Today , you can get a whole sequence of the three million pairs of the human genome to a cost of a close $ 20,000 and a week .
It 's not going to be a lot for the human genome for a $ 1,000 1,000 and being more and more than more .
They come from those changes .
The same technology that has produced human insulin , you can make virus that we 're not just going to protect them out , but they 're going to declare immunity against other viruses .
Believe it , or there 's not a experimental trial in course with the flu vaccine in a factory plant .
Can you imagine a good thing to go out of tobacco ?
That 's actually today and the future is going to be more possible .
Imagine , only other two small changes .
You can change the cells of their bodies , but if they could change the cells of their offspring ?
And if you could change the sperm and eggs , or to change the <unk> egg , and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life , <unk> diabetes , <unk> the risk of cancer ?
Who does n't want more healthy children ?
And then , that same analytical technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases , it 's going to allow us to allow us to use <unk> <unk> -- a better memory .
Why do n't you have the ingenuity of a Ken talk about everything if you could <unk> the next generation of the Watson .
Why do n't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more distance ?
Why do n't you live more time ?
This is going to be a cartoonist .
And when we 're in conditions of spending this to the next generation , and we could adopt the attributes we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk> .
We 're going to take a process that could n't take 100 thousand years , and we can take it back to 1,000 years , and maybe happen within the next 100 years .
These are choices that your grandchildren , or the grandchildren of their grandchildren , they 're going to have to do with them .
We 're going to use these choices in a better society , more successful , more successful ?
Or , we 're going to pick different attributes that we want for some of us , but not for others ?
We 're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform and more robust and more talented ?
This is the kind of question we 're going to deal with .
And the most profound of all : we 're going to be able to develop wisdom and the wisdom of the wisdom we need to take these decisions wisely ?
For good , and before what you might think about , these choices are going to depend on us .
Thank you .
Imagine a great explosion when you 're to 900 feet tall .
Imagine a plane full of smoke .
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . It sounds scary .
Well , I had a single seat that day . I was sitting in <unk> .
It was the only thing I could talk to the flight of flight .
So I immediately looked at them , and they said , `` There 's no problem . We probably had some birds . ''
The pilot had already been <unk> the plane , and we were n't so far away .
You could see Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
The <unk> pilot is the Hudson River .
This is not the route .
It 's going to take the motors .
Imagine being in a plane and no noises .
And then he said three words .
The three words I 've heard .
He said , `` <unk> for the impact . ''
I did n't have to talk more with the flight assistant .
I could see it in your eyes .
It was terror . Life ended up .
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day .
I learned that everything changes in a moment .
We have this list of things to do before they die , these things that we want to do in life , and I thought in all people who wanted to get , and I did n't , all the interfaces I wanted to repair , all the experiences I wanted to have and never had .
While I thought about that later , I came to a phrase , which is , `` I had bad wine . ''
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I 'm going to open .
I do n't want to do anything in life .
And that urge , it really has changed my life .
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is the bridge George Washington , which was n't for a lot -- I thought about , wow , I really feel a great spite .
I 've lived a good life .
In my humanity and my mistakes , I 've been trying to improve everything I did .
But in my humanity also give my ego .
And I 'm sorry the time to get in things that does n't matter with people who do matter .
And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
And then , like <unk> on that , I decided to remove the negative energy of my life .
It 's not perfect , but it 's a lot better .
In two years I have n't had a fight with my wife .
It feels a question .
I do n't try to be right ; they 're going to be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and this is what your mental clock is going to be <unk> , `` 15 , 14 , 13 . ''
You see the water <unk> .
I 'm saying , `` Please flies . ''
I do n't want this to be out there in 20 pieces , as you see in those documentaries .
And while <unk> , I had the feeling of , wow , they die not fear .
It 's almost as we 've been <unk> for it all our life .
But it was very sad .
I did n't want to go ; I love my life .
And that sadness was <unk> in a single thought , which is , just desire one thing .
I wish I could see my children growing .
A month later , I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade , not a lot of artistic talent -- -- still . And I scream , like a little bit .
And for me , that was all the reason to be the world .
In that point , I understood those two points , that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent .
For all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent .
I was given a miracle , to not die that day .
And I gave me another gift , which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way .
You 're flying today , the challenge that you can imagine that the same happens in your plane -- and please do n't be like this -- but imagine , and how to change ?
What is what they would , we still expect to do because they think they 're going to live forever ?
How do they change their relations and the negative energy in them ?
And most important , are the best parents that you can ?
Thank you .
I 've really been able to have been <unk> in life with many amazing projects .
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy .
The guy 's called <unk> .
It was one of the most important <unk> of the '80s .
A day , he came to her home after running and said , `` Dad , I feel a <unk> on the legs . ''
And that was the beginning of ALS .
We 've got a total paralysis .
You can only use your eyes .
His work was done in me .
I have a design company and animation so that , obviously , the graffiti is something that we admire and decide in the world of art .
So we decided that we were going to be done to Tony Tony , <unk> , and the cause .
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said , `` We 're going to give you this money .
What are they going to do with him ? ''
And his brother said , `` I just want to be able to talk about Tony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with him , and he can be able to communicate with me . ''
And I said , `` A second , is n't that I 've seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those devices ? ''
And he said , `` No , unless you be somebody 's important and you have a very good one , you ca n't do it .
These devices are not affordable for people . ''
And I said , `` Well , how they communicate then ? ''
Would you look at the film `` <unk> and the butterfly ? ''
They communicate that way -- they 're going to be stored with the finger .
I said , `` That 's <unk> . How can it be ? ''
So I showed me with the only desire to give a check , and instead he played a check that I had no idea of how he was going to cover .
I sat up with his brother and with his father there , `` All right , this is the deal : Tony 's going to build a machine , and we 're going to find a way to make its art again , and we 're going to find a way to make its art again .
Because it 's ridiculous that somebody who have so much in its interior . ''
So I talked about a couple months months later .
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research , that they have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface , and then , with a laser pointer , to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the negative space .
So they 're going to make art facilities like this .
All the things that appear , they 're part of a cycle of life .
First of the start with the sex organ , then with the bad words , then with the English attacks , and in the end , people start to make art .
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentations .
And so it started the journey .
And about two years later , close to a year later , after a lot of organization , and a lot of a lot of organization will move things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things .
One , we touch the doors of safe companies , and we get a machine so that we could be able to communicate -- a machine like Stephen Hawking .
Which was great .
And , seriously , it 's about the most fun ; I call him <unk> because I 'm talking to the guy , you get an email of him , and you say , `` No , I 'm not going to do it . This guy is fantastic . ''
The other thing we did was bring to seven programmers from all the world 's <unk> world to our house .
My wife , the children and me , we move to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house .
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid , and that when they would have taken the pictures of the walls and in its place would be graffiti .
But for two weeks , we went to the top of Venice , my son was part , my dog also , and we created this .
It 's called <unk> <unk> , and you can see the description .
It 's a couple of the cheap sun that we bought in the top of Venice Beach , a little bit of wire of copper and things from Home <unk> and National Home .
We take a <unk> camera , we open them up , we put it up on a light light , and now there 's a device that is free -- we published the code ; we published the code to <unk> the software on a free way .
And we created a device that has no limitation at all .
There 's no company to say `` No . ''
There 's no hospital that can say `` No . ''
Any person with paralysis has access to draw and communicate using their eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . That was amazing .
So , at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that is his room .
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening .
And then after a year of planning , two weeks of programming , <unk> sessions from all night , Tony came to draw for the first time in seven years .
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life , and it 's looking through the support system .
You know , the bed of the bed , so I could see .
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital .
And he came to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends , and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot .
The funny thing was that we had to do it in the parking lot , so they feel like we were <unk> the graffiti .
In the end of this , he was a email , and this was what we said , `` This was the first time I was in seven years .
I felt like he had been under the water , and somebody finally came to <unk> and take me back to me , so I could breathe . ''
Is n't a wonderful thing ?
In a certain way that 's our <unk> .
That 's what keeps us in movement , developing .
And we have a long way to go through this .
It 's a great device , but it 's the equivalent of a <unk> .
Anybody with this artistic potential , a lot more .
So we 're trying to figure out how to change and make it faster and robust .
Since we 've had all kinds of recognition .
We 've won a lot of prizes .
Remember , it 's free ; none of us is doing money with this .
All of our own pockets .
The prizes were , `` Oh , this is fantastic . ''
Armstrong saw something about us , and then , in December , Time magazine recognized , as one of the best 50 inventions of 2010 , and it was really great .
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close to the <unk> is that in April of this year in <unk> in the center of Los Angeles in the center of Los Angeles , is going to be an exhibition called `` Art in <unk> . ''
And `` Art in <unk> '' is going to have the best <unk> of the urban urban art , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all of them are going to be there .
It 's going to be in the show , which is pretty impressive .
So , basically this is my idea : if you see something that 's not possible , we can do it .
Nothing of what there is in this room , it was possible -- the computer , the computer , the microphone , the <unk> , all was possible at a certain moment .
So , anything about this room .
I 'm not a programmer , I 've never done anything with <unk> technology , and I simply recognized something and I 'm going to be <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen .
And these are the questions that I want everyone to do every day when we find something that we feel that we have to do . If it 's not now , when ? And if I 'm not , when I 'm not me , who ?
Thank you guys .
I 've spent the last few years in situations that 's usually very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time .
I went to prison -- difficult .
I worked on a coal mine -- dangerous .
It 's been involved in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun to the beginning , something difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
In fact , in great part of my career , I 've been <unk> in horrible situations with the only goal of trying to look at social issues of ways that , attractive , interesting things , and , hopefully , looking at them in a way that you look at simple and accessible to the audience .
So , when I knew I 'd come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands , and I wanted to do something a little bit different .
So , some of you can have heard , or not , a couple weeks ago , I took a student in <unk> .
I sent some messages on Facebook , a few on Twitter , I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011 .
What there was the next thing : `` We 're going to say , `` You know , <unk> <unk> : my TEDTalk that you do n't have an idea of what it 's about , and according to the content could be <unk> in the face , especially if I put it into the face to you or her company to do it .
But said this , it 's a very good media opportunity . ''
You know how many people look at these TEDTalks ?
Many .
It 's a degree in progress , by the way .
So , I knew that somebody was going to buy the rights of the name .
If I had asked a year ago , I could n't have been able to tell me to say .
But in the new film that I 'm working on , we looked at the world of marketing , of advertising .
And as I said earlier , I 've been in horrible situations in the last few years , but I 've got nothing to prepare , and I could make it , so difficult or as dangerous as they go into the rooms with these types .
You know , I had this idea for a film .
Morgan <unk> : I want to do a film that belongs to the <unk> of products , the marketing and advertising , and that everything was filmed with <unk> products , marketing and advertising .
The film is going to call `` The biggest film never sold . ''
What happens in `` The biggest film never sold , '' is that everything on the bottom , in early principle , has images of brand , all the time , from the <unk> that appears before the title , the X brand .
Now this brand , <unk> , the <unk> Center .
These people were <unk> by the film , forever .
And so the film is exploring all this idea . ( Michael <unk> : It 's why ?
I 'm a <unk> .
It was `` Machine .
But we 're not just going to have the sponsor of the <unk> , but we 're going to make sure that we 're going to make sure all the categories that we could in the film .
Perhaps they have a shoe , and it becomes the most great shoe that you have used ...
The most great car that you 've taken in `` The biggest film never sold , '' the best drink that you have to be able to drink , `` The biggest film never sold . ''
<unk> <unk> : The idea is then I 'm going to show the brands as part of the life , make them <unk> the film ? ( MS : So , that <unk> the film .
The goal of the whole film is transparency .
You 're going to see all the process on this film .
That 's the whole idea , all the film , in principle .
And I would love to be able to help them make it happen .
Robert Friedman : You know , it 's funny because it 's the first time I hear that ; it 's the best respect for the audience .
<unk> : However , I do n't know how it 's going to be people that 's going to be people .
<unk> : You have a perspective -- I do n't know if `` angle '' is very <unk> , but you know how it 's going to do ? ( MS : No idea .
MS : A million and a half million .
<unk> : Who knows , maybe for the time he 's going to go to the film , let 's look at it as a lot of idiots .
MS : What do you think it 's going to be the answer ?
Stuart <unk> : Most of the responses are `` No . ''
MS : But it will be difficult to sell it , by the film or me ?
JK : Both of things .
MS : It means that you 're not very optimistic .
So , help me ? I need help .
MK : I can help .
MS : All right . ( MK : Okay .
MK : We need to think about what brands .
MS : Yeah .
MK : We have some places where they go . ( MS : Okay .
MS : I thought it 's called the camera , '' meant we have a conversation out of a microphone .
It 's <unk> the camera , `` We do n't want to know anything about your movie . ''
MS : And so , one for one , all of these all of all these companies , all of all these companies .
Neither wanted to have anything to do with this film .
I was surprised .
They did n't want to know anything with this project .
And I was very impressed ; I thought that the concept of advertising , was to give the product to as much people as possible , so as much people saw it as possible .
Especially in the world today , this intersection of new media and old , and the stage of the recycled media , is n't the idea to tell with that new vehicle worthy vehicle that 's going to bring the message to the masses ?
No , that was what I thought .
But the problem was , you see , my idea had a <unk> mistake and that error was this .
It actually did n't , no mistake .
There was no mistake at all .
This would have been good .
But the problem was what represents this image .
See , when you search for images of <unk> ' images -- this is one of the first images that appear .
I like your way to roll . No .
This was the problem : transparency -- free and deception , easily , or seen , easily ; that 's easily understandable ; that 's characterized by the visibility or information of the information , about all of the business practices -- being the last problem .
You know , we hear a lot about transparency in these days .
Our political politicians , the president of the <unk> , even the CEOs .
But all of a sudden , when it comes to do it , it 's really something it changes a sudden .
But why ? Well , the transparency day fear -- like that weird bear , which is still the awkward bear .
It 's unpredictable -- like this weird path .
And it 's also very risky .
What else is a bad thing ?
It was a whole bowl of <unk> <unk> .
That 's very risky .
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , `` No , we want to tell you to be <unk> .
We want to tell a story to tell a story , but I read <unk> .
See , when I was a child , and my father gave me to me in some lie -- -- and there 's he looking at it as he used to say , `` Son , there are three sides in every history .
It 's your story , it 's my story , and it 's the real story . ''
As you see , in this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
But with only one company , a agency wanted to help me -- and that 's just because I knew to John Bond and Richard <unk> , I realized I would have to go through my mind , I would have to take up and go to the businesses myself with all my team .
So what I started to notice of a sudden , which I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the idea of your brand is a universal problem .
MS : I have friends who make big films , huge , giant and others who make small films , independent , like mine .
And my friends who make films with big Hollywood films , they say the reason why their films have so much success , because they have to do it .
And then my friends who make independent films , they say , `` Well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant films films ? ''
And the film is called `` The biggest film never sold . ''
How are we going to look specifically on the movie ?
Every time I 'm going to go out , every time I open my <unk> , you 're going to look at the mismatcher .
At any time for a interview for one interview , I can say , `` Are you cool for this interview ?
Are you ready ? You see a little nervous .
I want to help you tell you that you 're going to do you .
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . ''
And there 's one of these great <unk> .
So , `` <unk> <unk> , '' like `` <unk> of <unk> '' you 're going to have their opportunity .
We 're going to have so much for a man , as a woman , solid , <unk> , like it 's .
That 's the general look .
Now I can answer your questions and give them a <unk> look .
Sir Frank : We 're a small brand .
It takes to the kind of more small films that we 're going to have a <unk> brand .
So we do n't have the budget that have other brands .
So to do things like this , you know , remind people , is the reason why we 're interested in .
MS : What words would you use to describe ?
It 's in white .
KF : That 's a great question .
Woman : The top .
MS : It 's not the way you want to describe something that you want to describe something that you put in <unk> .
Man : We talk about something bold , cool .
I think , `` cool '' is a great word that actually put this category in positive versus `` combat the smell and sweat . ''
It 's cool .
How do we keep you cool more time ? With better people , more likely , three times more cool .
Things like those of the benefits .
MS : And that 's a <unk> company .
What about me ? What 's a common guy ?
I need to talk to the man of the street , people like me , to the ordinary <unk> .
They have to talk to me about my brand .
MS : How do you define your brand ?
Man : Mmm my brand ?
I do n't know .
I like the good clothes .
Woman : You get the '80s , <unk> <unk> .
MS : All right , what is the <unk> brand ?
<unk> : one single one . ( MS : unique .
I like a lot of the dark colors , many gray colors and things like this .
So , I 'm going to be able to be able to go out , as the Sun goggles , or I like the crystals and similar .
Woman : If Dan was a brand , could be a classic <unk> .
Man 2 : The brand that I 'm , I would call it <unk> .
Woman 2 : In part of hippie , in part of a <unk> , I do n't know .
Man 3 : I 'm the kind of the muscles .
It was toys for pets in the country and in the world .
So I guess that 's my brand .
In my small sector , that 's my brand .
Man 4 : My brand is crazy because they make their own staff .
Man : There was five failure .
Is that something ?
<unk> : I 'm a lawyer .
Tom : I 'm Tom .
MS : Well , we 're not all going to be done Tom , but I 'm going to get me in the intersection of <unk> dark and <unk> .
I realized I needed an expert .
I needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who could help me understand what 's called the `` <unk> personality . ''
And I found a company called Lima <unk> in Pittsburgh .
They helped businesses like <unk> , <unk> , attachment to discover that personality .
If they could do it for them , they could n't do it for me .
<unk> : <unk> the photos , right ?
MS : Yeah . The first picture is a family picture .
Video : Tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be .
MS : These people are looking at my way to see the world .
Video : Tell me about that world .
MS : That 's the world ? I think your world is the world that you live -- as the people around us , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
All of those things come from , and they start in a place , and in my case in my family , in West Virginia .
So what is the next one you want to talk about ?
MS : The next one is `` This was the best day of my life . ''
So , how does this relate to your thoughts , feelings and your way of being ?
MS : It 's like who wanted to be me .
I like the different things .
I like the weird things . I like the rare things .
Video : Tell me why .
What 's the lure ? What 's a phase phase ?
Why is it important ? What represents the red ?
Tell me a little bit about that .
It 's a little bit more than you , that is not who you 're .
What other <unk> have you had ?
You know , it does n't have to be fear .
MS : <unk> !
Video : Thank you for your patience . ( MS : Great work : Great . ( MS : Thank you very much .
MS : Yeah , I do n't know what 's going to go out of this .
There was a lot of madness .
<unk> <unk> : The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but <unk> , in your personality personality , <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand .
It was very good together .
And I think there 's almost a paradox in them .
And I think that some companies are just <unk> in one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on both .
Many companies tend to -- and it 's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that they 're not safe ; they avoid the fear , and you actually give them a bit positive and you do something positive for you , and it 's nice to see that .
What other brands are this ?
The first here is classical , Apple .
And you can see , also here to Target , you 're trying to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Now , there are <unk> and conscious brands , those things that have gone and come up , but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful .
MS : <unk> . What 's your brand ?
If somebody asks you to get your identity in a brand , your personality , what would it be ?
Are you a sunny mold ? You 're somebody who makes the blood flow ?
Or are you more well , you 're more good , you 're more good ?
A little bit more frustrated , training , conservative ?
The investment attributes are like being <unk> , like , contemporary , contemporary , boring , or audacious as <unk> <unk> , fast or robust , a dominant , a dominant , magical , magical , magical , magical or mystic .
Or are you more good than they 're right ?
Are you conscious , <unk> as <unk> ?
You 're established , traditional , <unk> , please have to say with Oprah ?
You 're reliable , stable , familiar , reliable , safe and wise or wise , like the Dalai Lama or <unk> ?
In the course of this film , we had more than 500 businesses and shelter , who said , `` No , '' they did n't want to be part of this project .
They did n't want to have anything to see with this film , primarily because they did n't have control , they would n't have control on the end product .
We allowed to tell the story of the <unk> , and we 're going to tell the story in this film of how now they use MRI , to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so for a commercial marketing , as a movie .
We went to San Paulo where they 've been forbidden the advertising .
In all the city for the last five years , there 's no treadmill , there 's no treadmill , nothing .
And we went to school districts that companies are getting up in the schools in the U.S. .
The amazing thing for me is that the projects in which I 've had the biggest response , or that I 've had more successful , are those who I 've seen with it directly .
And that 's what they did these brands .
They 're going to put it to the <unk> , they came to their agencies , and they said perhaps these agencies do n't have my best interest in mind .
I 'm going to do directly with the artist .
I 'm going to work with him to create something different , something that 's going to make people think about people , which is going to challenge the way we look at the world .
And how did you have gone ? They were successful ?
Well , the film went on the film , let 's take a look .
According to <unk> the film in January , and since then -- and this is not <unk> , we 've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film .
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half weeks .
That 's just online -- no press , no press .
The film still did n't be <unk> .
It 's still not the line . It 's not in <unk> .
It 's not even presented in other countries still .
Ultimately , this film has already started to make momentum .
And it 's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked to their clients to be not part .
I always believed that if you take risks , if you take risks , that in those risks there are opportunities .
I think , when you get to the people of that is pushing to the failure .
I think , when you train their employees at the risk of risk , it 's preparing all their company to try to heal .
I feel that what 's going to happen to happen is that we have to encourage people to risk .
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that can <unk> .
In the last reason , I think we have to give them to fear .
We have to put that bear in a cage .
They 're going to get the fear . They 're going to get the risk .
In a <unk> , we have to embrace the risk .
And , in the end , we have to stay to transparency .
Now , more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go back a long way .
And I said this , with honesty and transparency , all my talk `` <unk> <unk> , '' has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who per dollars bought the rights of the name in <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> great data data for companies around the world .
It 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much people .
June Cohen : So , Morgan , in the name of the transparency , which happened exactly with those dollars .
MS : It 's a fantastic question .
And in my pocket , I have a name of the TED matrix of TED , <unk> Foundation , a <unk> for $ me to be applied to my health to TED .
The idea behind the computer worm is actually very simple .
We do n't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb .
His biggest active weapons is the <unk> plant plant .
The gray boxes that you see is systems control systems .
If we 're able to engage these systems that control speeds and valves , we can cause a lot of problems with the aurochs .
The gray boxes are not using a different technology ; they 're a completely different technology .
But if we could put a cash effective virus in a portable computer used by an engineer for a collection for this gray box , then we 're ready .
This is the plan behind it .
We started with a Windows <unk> .
And the <unk> on the gray box , it does n't be the centrifuge , and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> , mission mission .
It 's easy , right ?
I want to tell you how we discovered this .
When we started researching about Stuxnet six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
The only thing that I knew is that it 's very , very complex in the middle of Windows , the <unk> would use multiple landscapes .
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these control systems .
That 's called the attention , and we started an experiment in which we have to have our environment with Karachi and saw what happened with this .
So , very strange things .
Manju as a rat rat , which I did n't like our cheese : the wave , but I did n't want to eat .
I had no sense for me .
And then we set up with different tastes of cheese , I realized , and I thought , `` This is a <unk> attack .
It 's completely moving . ''
The <unk> is looking at the <unk> in the gray box , if you find a specific configuration , and even if the program that 's trying to infect it is effectively working on that place .
If not , Zimbabwe does n't do anything .
So that called my attention , and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day , because I thought , `` We do n't know what the goal is . ''
It could be , say for example , a <unk> plant plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
So let 's get the target as soon .
So we decided and <unk> the code of attack , and we discovered that I was stored in two digital bombs : a small and a big .
We also saw that they were very professionally with people that obviously had all the internal information .
We 're going to get all the dots for them to attack .
You probably even know how much you 're going to do the operator .
So you know everything .
And if you 've heard that the <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the load is very complex .
It 's very above everything we 've seen before .
Here you see a sample of this code of attack .
We 're talking about 15 billion lines of code .
It seems pretty much to the old language language .
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code .
What we were looking for at the beginning of the system , because we know what they do .
Then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> structures and try to <unk> the real world , with potential goals of the real world .
We need theories about them that we can come to or <unk> .
To get to theories about goals , we remember that it 's definitely a violent <unk> , because it 's probably located in Iran , because it 's probably located in Iran , because it 's where most infections has been <unk> .
They do n't find several thousands of goals in that area .
It 's basically reduced to the nuclear energy plant , and the plant of <unk> <unk> .
So I said to my assistant , `` <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants between our clients . ''
He called him and I went into a effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data .
And it worked pretty well .
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the bison .
Forty is that part of a cell inside the aurochs , that black object you see .
If you 're going to play the speed of this bison , they can certainly be <unk> and even even make the centrifuge it 's .
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow , and you think it 's a obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers , so they could n't solve this very quickly .
We tried to figure out the digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures .
So , for example , the number <unk> on that code , you ca n't <unk> .
I started studying scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and I found that they 're stored in what 's called a waterfall , and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk> .
That had sense , there was a coincidence .
And they put better .
These <unk> in Iran are stored in 15 parts called the time .
And guess what we find in the code of attack ?
It 's almost identical .
So again , that was a good coincidence .
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands .
So , I did n't have happened .
The results have been out after several weeks of hard work .
It 's going to be <unk> in dead dead , and we had to go back .
Even so , we found that both digital tie would be able to be just and same goal , but from different angles .
The small <unk> is taking up a waterfall , and they 're going to spin the gorillas and <unk> , and the big <unk> is linked to six feet , and I rented valves .
In addition , we 're very confident that we 've determined what the thing is .
It 's <unk> , and it 's just <unk> .
We do n't want to worry that other goals are <unk> by decency .
Here I 'm showing you some very interesting things that we saw , really shocked me .
There 's the gray box , and you see the <unk> .
So what this thing is doing is <unk> the values of the sensors for example , of the sensors of the pressure and the sensors of vibration and provides legitimate code , which is still running during the attack , <unk> data data .
And believe , believe it or not , these false input data is <unk> by decency .
It 's like the Hollywood movies where , during the board , the security camera feeds out of <unk> .
Is it great ?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators of control .
It 's really much more dangerous and aggressive .
The idea is <unk> a digital security system .
We need digital security systems , where a human operator could n't act fast .
So for example , in a energy plant , when the great steam turbine is about speed , you have to open valves in a millisecond .
Obviously , this ca n't make a human operator .
That 's where we need digital security systems .
And when they 're engaged , then you can go to bad things .
The plant can exploit .
And no <unk> or the <unk> system .
That scares .
But it can be worse .
What I 'm going to say is very important .
Think about this . This attack is generic .
It does n't have anything to see , specifically , with <unk> .
It could work also , for example , in a energy plant , or in a automotive factory .
It 's generic .
And you do n't have to be like attacker -- which spread this burden with a USB key , as we saw in the case of Stuxnet .
You can also use the conventional technology for <unk> .
It 's the most possible thing .
And if you do that , with what we 're going to be with a <unk> of mass destruction .
That 's the consequence we need to face .
Unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the Middle East .
It 's in the United States and Japan .
All the green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals .
We have to deal with the consequences , and better that we start doing right now .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I have a question .
Ralph , there 's been public in many sides that people consider that <unk> is the main entity behind this .
What is your mind ?
Ralph <unk> : Okay , really want to hear this ?
Yeah . Okay .
My mind is that the <unk> is involved , but the engine is not Israel .
The engine behind this is the sweet superpower .
There 's one single one , and that 's the United States , fortunately , fortunately .
Because , in a way , our problems would be even bigger .
CA : Thank you for <unk> . Thank you , Ralph .
I want you to imagine a robot that can take up and give them <unk> skills , or another thing to make the users of the wheels , and you 're going to walk back .
In <unk> <unk> , '' we call these robots , exoskeletons .
It 's not anything different from something that you put in the morning , gives you a great force , which also increases its speed , and help it , for example , to deal with the equilibrium .
It 's actually the real integration of the man and the machine .
But it 's not just that -- you can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other foreign communities .
This is not an awful idea .
So to show you now , what we 're working on , we started talking about the American soldier that , in average , has to take on his back a $ 45 kilos , and it 's called you to take it even more equipment .
Obviously , this leads to some important complications -- injury in the back , in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> .
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help address the issue .
Let me introduce you to you the <unk> -- or <unk> Human <unk> .
Soldier : With the exoskeleton , I can carry 90 kilos per variable for many hours .
His flexible design , it allows you to put up and run it with a huge movement .
You know what I want to do , or where I want to go , and then it gets my strength and my resistance .
<unk> <unk> : We 're ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this new exoskeleton , this year .
Or , it 's a reality .
So let 's go back to the users of the wheels , about what I feel particularly passionate .
There are 68 million people about the wheels , in the entire world .
Like one percent of the total population .
And this is a really conservative calculation .
We talk about something that 's happening with often , very young people , with damage in the spinal cord , to the 20 , 30 or 40 years old -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair , it turns out to be its only choice .
We also talk about the population that you 're stored very quickly .
His only choice , a lot of times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- it 's the wheelchair .
And this has been so over the last 500 years , from their hope , as I should recognize .
So , we decided to start to write a new chapter chapter chapter .
Let me introduce you to you that you 're using <unk> <unk> who has 19 years ago he had a injury in the spinal cord , and as a result , could n't go back for 19 years , until now .
Amanda <unk> : Thank you .
EB : Amanda is using our <unk> , who was talking about .
It 's got some sensors .
It was completely not in the crutches that they send to the computer on board , here in your back .
Also here , there 's a little bit of the batteries that give the energy to the motors on the streets , and they do it , and they 're doing it with this soft and very natural spot .
AB : I was 24 years old at the top of my life when , by a strange jump in the air , skiing costs a paralyzed .
In a fraction of second , I lost all feeling , and it 's all the movement of the pelvis down .
Little time , a doctor went back to my room in the hospital , and he said , `` Amanda , you 're never going to walk . ''
That happened 19 years ago .
So let me go down to the last couple of hope of my being .
The technology of adaptation since then , I have allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> , and even building a bike bike .
But they have n't invented anything I could walk , until now .
Thank you .
EB : As you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit and talk to you .
It 's in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not only from soldiers , but to Amanda , and all the users of the wheels , all .
AB : Thank you .
I just went back from a community that has the secret of human survival .
It 's a place where women have the baton , they practice sex to say hello , and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is something serious .
And not , it 's not the festival of <unk> Man or San Francisco .
Ladies and gentlemen , know their cousins .
This is the world 's world of the forests of Congo .
The bonobos are , along with chimpanzees , their closest living relatives .
That means we all share a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years .
Now , chimpanzees are known by its aggression .
But unfortunately , we 've done too much about this way in our narratives of human evolution .
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency .
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by the big , you think , the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power .
These guys have created something special , because this leads to a very complex society where the fatal violence has n't observed .
But unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes .
They live in the depths of the <unk> jungle , and it 's been very difficult to study them .
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the <unk> -- the very violent conflict that has been created for decades and caused almost so many deaths like the First World War .
It 's not a wonder that this destruction will also put it in the survival of the Bonobo .
The beef trade , and deforestation do n't can fill up or a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and hopefully , we 're not safe .
However , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear the laughter in <unk> the trees .
Who are these cousins ?
We know it as the apes , `` make the love , not the war , '' because they have blind sex , <unk> and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems .
I 'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of mankind because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk> .
At the bonobos , as humans , I love play throughout your life .
Play is not just a game of children .
For us and for them , the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage tolerance .
With him we learn to trust , and we learn the rules of the game .
The game increases creativity and the resilience , and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
And when you look at the Bonobo game , you see the same evolutionary roots of laughter , the dance and human ritual .
The game is the glue that unites us .
I do n't know how you play you , but I want to show you a couple of only <unk> videos in the middle medium .
First of all , it 's a game of <unk> style , and I do n't talk soccer .
Here we have a female and a young male male .
Look what it 's doing .
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , `` He 's got out of the balls . ''
Just I think that in this case , he loves , right ?
Yeah .
So the sexual game is common as a human game .
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this particular video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements of the game -- like <unk> , and also how the game requires confidence , and the same time is the most fun thing .
But the game is <unk> .
The game is <unk> , it can adopt a lot of ways , some of which are more <unk> , a curious , curious -- maybe the place where you 're going to be able to get the wonder .
And I want you to see -- this is <unk> , a young female , which is playing with the water .
I think , as she , sometimes we play alone , and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside .
And it 's that curiosity that makes us explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we 're going to are the real side of creativity .
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present .
But they also have a secret to our future , a future , which we have to adapt to a world every more and more difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation .
The secret is that play is the key of these capabilities .
In other words , the game is our <unk> of adaptation .
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play .
But , <unk> the most of our ability to play ?
The game is not a picture .
The game is essential .
For bonobos and humans , life is not just cruel and 3G .
When it looks at the least right thing to play , you can be the moments that is the most urgent thing .
So , you give you primates , let 's give this gift of evolution and play together , as we give creativity , friendship and wonder .
Thank you .
In New York , I 'm responsible for an development of a nonprofit organization called Robin Parker .
When I 'm not fighting poverty , <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a body of firemen .
And , in our city , where the political volunteers , where the volunteers , you have to get a highly trained staff , you have to get to the fire of the fire very soon to go into action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer on the site , so I had a pretty high chance to go .
But yet there was a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was .
When I found the captain , I was <unk> in a conversation that I did n't take one of the worst days of his life .
We were in the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the rain , under an umbrella , in a shoe , <unk> , while his house was in fire .
The other volunteer that I 'd just come before , <unk> <unk> came first to the captain , and he asked him to go back and save the dog 's dog .
The dog ! I was <unk> .
There was a lawyer or <unk> for money that , during the rest of his life , would have to tell people that I walked in a building in a switch to save a living self , because I won it for five seconds .
Well , I was the next one .
The captain did a <unk> .
He said , `` Bezos , I need to be on the house .
I need to go back , <unk> the fire , and I give this woman a couple of shoes . ''
I swear .
It was n't exactly what I was expected , and I went down to the stairs , at the end of the hallway , I went to the firemen <unk> , '' which to the more or less had gone out of fire .
I know what they 're thinking , but I 'm not a hero .
I took my load back on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the main door .
We 're going to be able to get the house to the house of home where , as it was to wait , his treasure received a lot more attention than mine .
A few weeks later the department was received a letter from the <unk> of home , <unk> for the brave effort to save his house .
The kindness that she looked at the other thing was that somebody had reached a couple of shoes .
So both of my calling in the Milky Way , like in my calling as a volunteer fireman , I 'm witness to generosity and kindness in a monumental scale , but also of acts of grace and courage to level level .
And you know what I 've learned ?
Everything has its importance .
So , when I look at this room to people who have achieved , or they 're doing remarkable levels of success , I 'd like to remind you this : Do n't wait .
Do n't wait to win the first million to make the difference in your life .
If you have something to give , <unk> now .
<unk> food in a dining room , <unk> a park in the neighborhood .
They 're mentors .
Not every day , we 're going to have the opportunity to save your life of someone , but every day we 're going to be able to influence your life of somebody .
So they get to the game ; they 're going to get the shoes .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark comes back .
Mark Bezos : Thank you .
This can seem strange , but I 'm a great fan of the concrete block of the concrete block .
And the first particular blocks of concrete is in contrast to a very simple idea , a very simple idea , from concrete from a fixed extent that fit between itself .
Very quickly , these became the most likely unit in the world .
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we , as buildings or bridges , a brick at the time .
Essentially , these blocks have become the pillars of our time .
Almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , all happened on this .
It was called the brick of the ATM .
And in a few years , the bricks of conservatives came to all the homes .
It 's estimated that they 've been made more than 400 billion or 75 electrodes per person on the planet .
There is no engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or houses .
Put it accessible .
Egan simply adopted the block of concrete , the favorite in the world , and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination .
Meanwhile , exactly that same year , in Bell , the next revolution was about <unk> : the new building block .
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that we would take us from a <unk> world , about other to a world where everything was interactive .
The same thing that the particular block , the transistor allows you to create a lot higher and more complex , a brick at the time .
But there 's a main difference : the transistor was just for experts .
I personally do n't accept it , that the building blocks of our time are getting to the experts , so I decided to change .
About eight years ago , when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring the idea of the power of engineers and designers .
I started to develop <unk> .
I 'm going to show you how they work .
<unk> are electronics every one with a specific function .
They 're <unk> to be light , sound and sensors .
And the best thing is that they join by magnets .
So you ca n't get a wrong way .
We have a code of colors .
The green is the way , the blue is the stream , the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire .
So there 's only one blue blue one , and very quickly , you can start to do bigger circuitry .
A blue blue of you produce light .
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a transistor .
If we change the button for a pulse , which is here , and now we have one light .
We 're going to get this celebrity to create more impact and have a noise machine .
I 'm going to stop this .
So beyond the simple game , <unk> are actually very powerful .
Instead of having to program , connect and <unk> , <unk> allows us to program it by very simple <unk> gestures .
To do a faster or more slow , it 's just taking this button that makes the heart is faster or slower .
The idea behind <unk> is that it 's a growing collection .
We want all of the interactions in the world , we want to make the interactions on the world , we want to use it .
<unk> , sound , solar panels , motors ; everything must be accessible .
We 've given the kids to get them to play with them .
And it 's been an amazing experience .
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that do n't learn in schools .
For example , how a light light works , or why the door of a elevator is stored , or how a iPod responds to touch .
We 've also taken <unk> to the design schools .
So , for example , designers without experience , they start playing with <unk> as a material .
Here you can see , with a paper of paper and felt , we have <unk> .
It 's a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , we took the designers of the Design School of Rhode Island , which has no experience in engineering , just in cardboard and paper and we said , `` Do something .
Here 's an example of a project that they 've done , a <unk> cannon .
But wait , here 's my favorite project .
It 's a <unk> <unk> that 's made of the darkness .
For these no engineers , <unk> became another material , the electronic became another material .
And we want this material to be the rest of all .
So , <unk> has open code .
You can visit the website , you download all the files files of design and <unk> .
We want to encourage a world of the creators , inventors and collaborators because this world where we live , this interactive world , is our .
So ahead and invent .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you about the unexpected discoveries .
I work on the industry of the solar technology .
And my small company is looking for the environment .
So , distributed collaboration .
This is a little video of what we do .
Mmm . Wait a moment .
You can take a little bit in charge .
We can -- we can continue to continue the video to one side .
No .
This is not ...
All right .
The solar technology is ...
Oh , I 'm going to have a term time ?
All right . Thank you very much .
A couple of years ago , I started a initiative to recruit the best designers and technical algorithms that you take a year and work in a environment that represents almost everything that 's supposed to hate ; we asked them to work on the government .
The initiative was called <unk> for America , and it would be like a little bit of <unk> in Peace .
We 've got some members every year , and we put them to work with the municipalities .
Instead of telling the Third World we put the wild world to the wild world .
They made great applications ; they worked with the middle employees .
His task is to show the possibilities of the current technology .
You know .
When it 's a fire fire .
Here it looks like a quote , but what it 's really looking for it when you 're trapped by the snow , because it knows that it 's not very good to poison fires when it 's covered by a meter meter .
How did they ask to ask for this way ?
Last year in Boston , we had a team of <unk> members for America .
They were there in February and at that moment a lot of last year .
They realized that the city would never give these hydrants .
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something more : that citizens would be able to put the sidewalks to each other in front of them .
So he did like any good programmer , I developed an app .
It 's a cute application that you can adopt a fire fire .
You know , you know , you 're going to take them out when you 're going to be <unk> .
When I do it , you put a name , in this case he put it up .
If you do n't do it , somebody can <unk> .
Or , it has a <unk> component .
It 's a modest application .
Perhaps it 's the smallest of the 21 applications that last year .
But it makes something that no other technology technology .
And the viral form .
It 's a responsible basis of systems of the NGO City when you see this application realized that I could use it , not for the snow , but so the citizens have been born from tsunami .
It 's very important that I work on the tsunami of tsunami , but people are given the batteries .
That 's why you ask the citizens to control .
And then Seattle decided to use it to do that the citizens are going to be <unk> .
And Chicago has just put it to make people put up to make people go back to clean sidewalks when they 're going to <unk> .
So , we know about nine cities that would be able to use it .
And this has been <unk> , and it 's a natural way .
If you know a little bit of government technology knows that this does n't happen .
The acquisition of software takes a couple of years .
Last year in Boston , we had a team working on a project that took three people for two months and a half months .
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children .
Then they told us that I 've done by the normal channels , would have taken at least two years , and it 's about two million dollars .
And that 's not anything .
Now there 's a project in the power of California that to the time has 2,000 million dollars and it does n't work .
And there are projects like this in every level of government .
So , one application that 's a couple of days , and it 's expanding in viral form , it 's kind of <unk> to the institution of the government .
It suggests to the world 's best ways to work , not like private companies , as a lot of people think it should be .
Not like a technological company , but more like the Internet .
I mean , without restrictions , in a open way and rotates .
And that 's important .
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way of addressing the matter of the government , not as a problem of an institution , but as a problem of collective action .
And that 's very good because it turns out that we 're very good for the collective action with digital technology .
And there 's a very big community of people who are building the tools for us to deal with efficacy .
And it 's not just <unk> for America , but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute with <unk> apps every day in their own communities .
They have n't been given to the government .
They feel a great frustration to that , but it does n't complain , we can do it .
And this people know something we 've lost .
And it 's that if we leave the feelings of the politics , the row in the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- and all those other things that we put crazy , the government is , essentially , in words of Tim <unk> , `` What we do together because we alone ca n't . ''
Now , a lot of people have moved the government .
If you 're one of those people , I would ask you to do it , because things are changing .
Politics does n't change ; the government know .
And given the government in the last point of us -- remember that `` We , the people , '' the way of thinking about the way of producing change .
I did n't know a lot of government when I started with this .
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to take people to take people to use charges .
Well , after two years I 've come to the conclusion that the government is , especially , about <unk> .
This is the center of <unk> and information .
It 's the place that we use the calls if you put them in the United States .
Scott <unk> this call .
He said , `` <unk> '' in the base of official knowledge .
I did n't find anything . It started with animal control .
And he finally said , `` Hey , you can open the door doors , put music right and see if it 's going ? ''
And it worked . So for Scott .
But that was n't the end of the <unk> .
Boston does n't have a center of calls .
It 's got an app , web and mobile , called <unk> <unk> .
You do n't get that application .
It was the work of very intelligent people in the Office of New York City .
So one day , this really happened , is this saying , `` <unk> on my garbage cube . I do n't know if it 's dead .
How do I do to do it ? ''
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> .
Scott was talking to you .
In <unk> <unk> .
In this case , he saw a neighbor .
The next report said , `` I went back to the place , I found the circle of garbage behind the house .
<unk> ? Yeah .
He sent the cube . I went home .
Good night , sweet <unk> . ''
Pretty simple .
This is great . It 's the CEO of the digital and the physical .
And it 's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration distributed .
But it 's also a great example of government as a platform .
And here I do n't necessarily mean the scientific definition of platform .
I 'm talking about a platform for people who are <unk> and help others .
So , a citizen helped another , but the government had a key role .
It connected to two people .
And it could have been connected with the government services to be necessary , but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services .
When a neighbor helps another , <unk> communities .
If we call the control of animals , that costs a lot of money .
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it 's not the same thing that politics .
A lot of people understand it , but think that you think is the input of the other .
That our input is the vote .
How many times have been chosen to a political leader , sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader , and then we hope that the government reflects our values and affect our needs , but we do n't see changes .
That 's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the <unk> layer of 15 inches .
This is why we call bureaucracy .
And we say that word with a lot of contempt .
But it 's that contempt that keeps us that , which is something that we put in our against , that other thing , and in a consequence , we 're losing the power .
People believe that politics is sensual .
If we want this institution to work that the bureaucracy is sensual .
Because it 's where the real work of the government work .
We need to collaborate with the machinery of the government .
That makes the <unk> movement .
Have you seen ?
It 's a group of citizens worried that have been written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the <unk> of the <unk> for financial reform .
That 's not political activism , it 's activism .
And so , for those that we 've got to do with the government , it 's time to ask us what we want to leave our children .
You have to see the huge challenges that they 're going to face .
You really believe that we have to go without fix the institution that can act on the name of all ?
We ca n't do it with government , we need to be more effective .
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of the government , the function of the government that can expand to civil society .
There 's a generation that grew up with the Internet , and it knows that it 's not so hard to act <unk> , only there are the systems of the right way .
The average age of our members is about 28 years , so I 'm going to be , I 'm a higher generation that many of them .
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and give that almost for granted .
They 're not giving that battle that we 're going to talk about ; everyone will talk about .
You can express their opinions anywhere at the same time , and they do it .
So when they deal with the problem of the government , it does n't matter a lot of making your voices .
They 're using the hands .
They get hands on the work to program applications that do better work the government .
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities .
It can be cleaning up a fire , and it 's going to get rid of <unk> , rotate a result of garbage that has a <unk> inside .
Since then , we were always carrying those hydrants and a lot of people do it .
But these applications are like a digital sample that we 're not only consumers , not only are consumers of government that pay tax and get services .
We 're more than that , we 're citizens .
And we 're not going to fix the government until they do n't have the citizenship .
So I want to ask all of them , when it 's about the important things that we have to do together , all together , we 're going to be a crowd of voices , or also we 're going to be a crowd of hands ?
Thank you .
This is for me a real honor .
I 've spent most of the time in prisons , prisons and the death of death .
I 've spent most of my life in <unk> communities , in projects and places where there are a lot of despair .
And I 'm going to be here at TED , and you 'll hear these stimulus has given me a lot of energy .
One of the things I 've noticed in this short time , is that TED has identity .
And the things that you say here have impact around the world .
In times , if something comes to TED , it has a sense and a force that would n't have another way .
I mean this because I think identity is important .
Here we 've seen fantastic presentations .
And I think we 've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of meaning , but if they teach with feeling , you can have a special meaning .
A doctor can do good things , <unk> if it 's <unk> , it can do much more .
So I want to talk about the power of identity .
I actually did n't learn this in the practice of the right , my work .
I learned about my grandmother .
I grew up in a traditional family of a U.S. family , who was my grandmother .
It was hard , it was very strong .
It was the last word in the family in the family .
She takes a lot of <unk> in our home .
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves .
His parents were born in the slavery in Virginia .
She was born on the droughts and its experience with slavery , the way it looked like the world .
She was hard , but it was also loving .
When I was a little bit , and I looked at it , she went back and give me a good hug .
It was so strong I could barely breathe and then left me .
One or two hours later , I went back to look at it , and he said , `` <unk> , I still feel my hug ? ''
And if I said , I did n't , again , and if I said , yes , I was going to stop peace .
I had this human quality that I would always want to be close to her .
The only problem is that I had 10 children .
My mother was the lowest for 10 .
Instead , when I was going to spend a time with her , it was n't easy to get their time and your attention .
My cousins were running everywhere .
I remember when I was eight nine years old , I woke up in the room , and there were running all my cousins .
My grandmother was the other side of the room and looked at me .
When I thought it was a game .
So I looked at it and smile , but she was very serious .
After 15 minutes , she got up , he took my room , I took me from the hand , and he said , `` You see <unk> . The two are going to talk . ''
I remember this as it was yesterday .
I never forget it .
It took me out , and he said , `` <unk> , I 'll tell you something , but you ca n't say anything to me . ''
I said , `` It 's okay , Mama . ''
She said , `` Now we 're going to do it . '' I said , `` Sure . ''
Then I sat down , and he said , `` I want you to know I 've been looking at you . ''
And he said , `` I think you 're special . ''
He said , `` I think you can do what you want . ''
I never forget it .
Then he said , `` I just want me to give me three things , <unk> . ''
I said , `` Sure , Mama . ''
And he said , `` The first thing I want to tell me is you always want your mother . ''
<unk> : `` She 's my <unk> , and you 've got to be <unk> that always <unk> . ''
As I went to my mom , I said , `` Yes , Mama , I 'm going to do it . ''
Then he said , `` The second thing I want me to do is that you 're always going to do the right thing , although the right thing is how difficult . ''
I thought , and I said , `` Yes , Mama . So I 'm going to do . ''
Then , they finally said , `` The third thing I want me to do is that never <unk> alcohol . ''
I was nine years old , and I said , `` Yes , Mama , I 'm going to do it . ''
I grew up in the field , in South Africa , I have a younger year and a sister a lower year .
When I was 14 15 , a day my brother came home with a package of six beers , I do n't know where he pulled out , brought me my sister and me , and we went to the forest .
We 're going to be doing the <unk> .
He took a little bit of beer , he offered my sister , she took a little bit and offered me to me .
I said , `` No , no , no . It 's right . You 're going to go , but I 'm not going to take beer . ''
My brother said , `` Come on . We 're going to do it , and you always do the same thing that we .
I just took something , your sister too . Take a beer . ''
I said , `` No . I do n't feel good . You can go . ''
Then my brother looked at me .
He said , `` What happens ? Take a beer . ''
I put it up with strength , and he went , `` Oh , you 're not going to be thinking about the conversation with Mama . ''
I said , `` But what are you talking about ? ''
He said , `` Mama tells you all the grandchildren who are special . ''
I was born .
I have to admit something to you .
I 'll tell you something that probably should n't say .
I know this is widely spread .
But I have about 52 years , and I can admit that I 've never taken not a drop of alcohol .
I do n't say this to be a virtue of virtue ; I say it for the power that has an identity .
When we created the right kind of identity , we say things to the others that they actually do n't see meaning .
We ca n't get to do things that do n't believe to do .
I think my grandmother just believed that everyone was special .
My grandfather had been in the ban for the ban .
My uncles died about alcohol .
And these were the things that , according to her , we had to be engaged .
Now , I 'm trying to talk about our criminal justice system .
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago .
In 1972 there were 300,000 prisoners .
Today , there are millions .
In the United States , we have the most incarceration rate of the world .
We have seven million people in the opposite freedom .
And this massive incarceration , in my mind , has changed fundamentally our world .
In poor communities or black , you find so much <unk> , so much of these facts .
One of every three black black between the 18 and 30 years , is in prison or <unk> .
In the States of all the country , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the young color of color are in prison or freedom .
Our system is not just <unk> in front of the race , it 's also about poverty .
In this country , we have a judicial system that 's a lot better if you 're rich and guilty , that if you 're poor and innocent .
It 's not guilt , but wealth 's wealth .
And it seems to be very quiet .
And the politics of fear and anger , they do n't believe that these are not problems of our own .
We 're disconnected .
It seems interesting .
We 're looking at our work in our work .
In my state , in Alabama , as in other states , you 're <unk> for the rights sentence because you have a criminal sentence .
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of the black male population has lost the right to vote .
And if we use it to the next 10 years , the level of the rights of rights to be as much as before we took the law of the right to vote .
We have this amazing silence .
I 've got kids .
Many of my clients are very young .
America is the only country in the world , which is the only country of the world to 13 years to die in prison .
We have this country prison for children , without possibility to go out .
Right now , we 're in a process of <unk> .
The only country in the world .
I played people in the death row .
This is interesting .
In some sense , you have to think that the final question is , people deserve to die by <unk> <unk> ?
A very responsive question .
But you can think of another way about how we 're in our identity .
There 's another way of looking , it 's not about to decide if people deserve to die by the political crimes , but , if we deserve to kill .
This is interesting .
Death death is defined by error .
In every nine people , it has been identified that it 's <unk> and released from the death row of death .
A bit of error , amazing , a <unk> of every nine .
This is interesting .
In aviation , we could n't be able to be able to be able to fly aircraft if every nine nine , you would have from <unk> .
But in some way we saw the problem .
It 's not our problem .
It 's not our load .
It 's not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these things .
I 'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill .
It 's interesting that in my classes with students about the Indian history , I 'm talking about slavery .
I 'm talking about terrorism , the time he started at the end of the reconstruction and lasted to the Second World War .
Really , we do n't know a lot of this .
But for the Americans in this country , it was a little bit about the terror .
In many communities , people were afraid to be <unk> .
It was going to be bombarded .
The threat of terror was what defined their lives .
Now , there are older people who get close to me and say , `` Mr. Sagan , you hear talks , they 're going to talk to the people who let me say that in our history of dealing with terrorism , after <unk> . ''
They ask me to say , `` No . Hi , we grew up with that . ''
The era of terrorism went on , obviously , with the segregation and decades of <unk> and separation .
In this country , we have a dynamic why we do n't like to talk about our problems .
We do n't like to talk about our story .
And it 's why we have n't understood the meaning of what we 've done .
All of the time we 're born with others .
We constantly create tensions and conflict .
It takes work to talk about races . I think it 's because we 're not willing to hide with a process of truth and reconciliation .
In South Africa , people know that I could n't get to the Democratic segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation .
In Rwanda , even before the genocide had this compromise , but in this country we did n't .
I was in Germany to give talks about death death .
It was fascinating , because one of the teachers , I 've got after my presentation , and he said , `` You know , you know , you know , you know , listening to what they say . ''
<unk> : `` We do n't have death death in Germany .
You can never be able to get it here . ''
The room was stuck in silence and a lady said , `` There 's no way of our history , we could never get into the systematic death of human beings .
It would be irrational that we and the deliberately and deliberately , we could run people . ''
You know , <unk> about this .
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany , we would have people , especially if they were in their own Jews ?
We could n't tolerate it .
It would be irrational .
And yet , there 's this disconnect .
I think our identity is in danger .
If we actually do n't care about these very difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are , yet .
We love innovation .
And I 'm fascinated the technology . It 's <unk> creativity .
We love the entertainment .
But lately , those realities are <unk> by suffering , abuse , degradation , <unk> .
In my mind , you need to integrate both things .
We talked about the need to have more hope , more commitment , more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world .
I think that means that it wants to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor , the <unk> , who never come to TED .
Think of them is , in a certain way , something that 's inside our being .
It 's true we have to believe in issues we have n't seen .
So we are . In spite of being as rational , so engaged with the intellectual .
It 's the innovation , with creativity . The development is not just about the brain ideas .
These things come from ideas , also by the convictions of the heart .
This connection of the mind with the heart is what makes us look at it not just in the brilliant and hopefully , but also in the dark and the difficult .
Shift <unk> , the great leader , talked about this .
He said , `` When we were in East Europe suffering to oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but primarily what we needed was hope , orientation for the spirit , a will just be in sites of despair and be imagined . ''
Well , that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think , that even in communities like TED , it must be engaged .
There 's no disconnect related to technology and design , that we allow us to be truly humans if we do n't pay attention to poverty , to the exclusion , to inequality , to the inequality of inequality .
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity that if we ignore these things .
We go back to you .
I had a very young lawyer , being a very young lawyer , to meet Pink .
These women came together to speak .
Occasionally , the <unk> lady called me , to tell me , `` Oh , <unk> , it comes the lady 's lady . We 're going to bring together to speak .
Do you want to come and hear ? ''
I said , `` Yeah , lady . I know .
So she said , `` Well , and what are you going to do when you come ? ''
I said , `` <unk> . ''
So , I was going and just listened .
It was something very <unk> , very <unk> .
And I was there , listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , Mrs. Hillis was led to me and said , `` Now , <unk> , tell me that it 's that idea of equal justice .
Tell me what you 're trying to do . ''
And I started to give my speech .
I said , `` Well , we 're trying to question injustice .
We 're trying to help those who have been diagnosed with been diagnosed .
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice administration .
We 're trying to be able to end up with the money of life , without freedom to the children .
We try to do something about death .
We try to reduce the population in the prisons .
We 're trying to be able to end up with a massive <unk> . ''
He gave all my best speech , and I 'm going to end me up and said , `` Mmm . ''
And he said , `` You 're going to be exhausted , very exhausted . ''
At that moment , Mrs. <unk> came up , he put me the finger on the face and said , `` That 's why you have to be very , very brave . ''
I think , actually , the TED community has to be much more <unk> .
We need to find the way to face those challenges , those problems , that suffering .
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others .
I 've learned some very simple things in my work .
I 've been educated in simple things .
I 've come to understand that every one of us is higher to the worst thing we 've done .
I think that 's true for all the world on the planet .
I 'm convinced that if somebody says a lie , it 's not because it 's a bullet .
I 'm sure , if somebody takes something that does n't belongs to it , it 's not that it 's a bike .
Even , if someone kills another , it 's not a murderer .
So I think there 's a basic dignity in people who must be respected by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly , in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
This is not .
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice .
And finally , I think that even though it 's very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , you do n't tell us for our technology , by our design , not for our intellectual capacity or rational , rational capacity .
In the end of the character , the character of a society , not for the way they treat the rich , powerful and privileged , but by the way they treat the poor , the prisoners , prisoners .
Because it 's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are .
I 'm going to be wrong . I 'm going to end up with a story .
Sometimes I do too much force .
They 're tired , like everyone .
Sometimes those ideas are going beyond my own important way .
I 've been based on these kids who have been convicted with a lot of <unk> .
I 'm going to prison , and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years , who have been <unk> for them as adults .
And I start thinking , how can it be ?
How can a judge turn someone on what 's not ?
The judge 's <unk> as an adult , but I see a child .
A very late night , I was awake thinking -- for God , if the judge can become something that you 're not , you have to have magic powers .
Yeah , <unk> , the judge has magical powers .
You should ask something about that .
As it was very late , I could n't think properly , but I started working on a <unk> .
He had a six-year-old client , a small , black , black .
I started working on the <unk> , with a <unk> that was saying , `` <unk> for my black client of 14 years to be treated as a high-tech 's emotional . ''
In the <unk> , I had there have been a little bit of <unk> behavior , in the behavior of police behavior and the process .
There was a line on how in this country , there 's no ethics , but a whole lack of ethics .
On the next morning , I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream , or I really wrote it ?
For my horror , I did n't just have <unk> , but he had been sent to the court .
It was about two months , I 've been already forgotten .
And I finally decided -- `` God , I have to go to the court for this stupid case .
I went back to the car , and I was really excited , overwhelmed .
I went in the car to the middle .
I thought this would be very difficult and ballet .
I finally came out of the car . He went to the court .
I was going to go down the stairs when I found myself with a older black man ; it was a bit bigger .
When I saw me , I came up and said , `` Who is you ? ''
I said , `` I 'm a lawyer . '' He said , `` Is you a lawyer ? '' I said yes .
So I came up and give me .
And let me go back to the ear .
He said , `` I 'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that that was <unk> .
That was deeply connected with my identity , with my identity with the capacity that we all have to contribute the community with a vision of hope .
Well , I went into the room of audiences .
When you enter , the judge saw me .
And he said , `` Mr. Sagan , you wrote this bold <unk> ? ''
I said , `` Yes , Mr. went . '' And we started to discuss .
People started to get . They 're all very upset .
I was the one that had been written .
They came up the policemen , the fiscal fiscal policemen .
In soon , I did n't know how , the room was full of people , because we were talking about races , because we 're talking about poverty , because we talked about poverty .
With the <unk> of the eye , I was able to see the process that was going and came .
I looked at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk> .
It was walking over here and for there .
Finally , this old black old , with a face of concern , and I sat behind me , almost on the table of the lawyers .
About 10 minutes later , the judge would take a kiss .
During the break a assistant , I showed it to me , because he had come back in the room .
The assistant came up on the old black black .
He said , `` Jimmy , what do you do in the room of audiences ? ''
And the old black man stood up , I looked at me , and he looked at me and said , `` I went to this room of audiences to tell this young man who put his view on the target . ''
I 've been today to TED because I think , many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big , but it moves to justice .
That we can not be truly human beings , if we do n't worry about human rights and for dignity .
That our survival is connected to others .
That our vision of technology , design , entertainment , and creativity must be used to photosynthesis , compassion and justice .
And above all of all , those of those who share this , I just want to tell you that they 're going to get your view on the target .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : You 've got to hear and see a logical desire of the audience , of this community , to help in your purposes , to do something .
Something that 's not a check . What can we do ?
<unk> : There are several opportunities close .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there will be a <unk> of this spring in which you 're going to do a effort for <unk> the funds that are spending today in punishment policy .
For example , here in California , you 're going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years , in the next five million dollars .
And in spite of this , <unk> percent of the cases , not <unk> .
Fifty percent of the speakers do n't come to anything .
Here 's a chance of change .
This <unk> is going to propose that they 're going to get these funding to make the law , to security .
I think there 's a very close opportunity .
CA : There 's been a huge decline in the crime in the last three decades .
Part of the explanation , it tells you that it 's got to do with the greatest percent rate .
What would you say it is this ?
<unk> : Actually , the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable .
The great growth in this country is not by crimes with violence .
It 's the wrong war against drugs .
That 's why you know this dramatic increase in the <unk> population .
And we let me convince the rhetoric of punishment .
We have three legal causes to bring people to life , by taking a bike , by small crimes against the property , instead of making those resources to their victims .
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less .
It seems that our current philosophy on the punishment does n't do anything for anyone .
I think that 's the orientation that has to change .
CA : <unk> , you 're excited about today .
You 're very inspiring .
Thank you very much for having come to TED . Thank you .
Voice : They get the threats for death 's death death .
Voice 2 : <unk> in Somalia .
Voice 2 : You know , <unk> , <unk> .
Announcer : It 's a social <unk> : <unk> <unk> : 65 dead .
Voice 2 : <unk> of tsunami .
A lot of <unk> : War . It 's going to be massive .
You know , <unk> . They 're going to end up . Egypt . Syria .
LG : Death .
Oh , my God !
Peter Diamandis : These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months , <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years .
The idea is that the media media would prefer <unk> news news because our minds are paid attention .
And that responds to a very good reason .
In every second of every day , our senses get many more data data than the brain can process .
And as anything matters to us more than survive , the first stop of all those data is an excerpt of the temporary lobe called Levine .
The amygdala is our early stage detector , the danger of danger .
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm .
So that 's why of a <unk> , <unk> stories .
That old saying of the press , `` If there 's a blood , sells . '' It 's very true .
And because all of the digital devices give us the great news , the seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , it 's not a wonder that we 're pessimistic .
Not surprising people think the world 's going to be wrong in the worst .
But maybe it 's not like this .
Maybe , in change , what 's really happening is that we got <unk> .
Perhaps the enormous progress made in the last century , for a series of forces , is to be able to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
I 'm not saying that we do n't have our good problems , the climate change , the extinction of species , the scarcity of water and energy ; without certainly we have .
As human beings are very good to <unk> the problems and , in the long , we just have with them .
Let 's take it in the last century to see where we go .
In the last hundred years , the average life of life has more than doubled income per capita per capita has tripled around the world .
A child mortality has been missing 10 times .
Also , the cost of food , of electricity and communications , has gone from 10 to 1,000 times .
Steve symbiosis showed us that we 're living the most peaceful time of human history .
And Charles was that the global literacy of 25 percent over the last 130 years .
We 're really living an extraordinary time .
Many people forget it .
And we 're still able to give them a higher expectations .
In fact , we redefine the meaning of poverty .
Think about the United States , a lot of people who live under the line of poverty , water , bathrooms , refrigerators , mobile , mobile , air conditioning and cars .
The <unk> <unk> of the last century , the <unk> of the planet , you would have ever dreamed of memorable .
It 's a lot of this is technology and , lately , its exponential growth .
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in this curve , Moore 's Law , and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months .
So the mobile reason you have in your pocket , it 's a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the 1970s .
Now look at this curve .
It 's Moore 's Law for the last hundred years .
I want you to look two things on this curve .
First , the soft thing that is -- in good times , in the war and in peace , in recession , in depression , in depression and <unk> .
It 's the cheap computers that used to build faster computers .
It does n't stop to none of the big challenges .
And although it 's <unk> in a law on the left , it 's going to go up .
The growth rate of technology is actually faster and faster .
And in this curve , <unk> of Moore 's Law , there 's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today .
The computation in the cloud , that my friends of Autodesk are infinite computation , sensors and networks , robotics , 3D printing , and its ability to democratize and distribute production on the whole planet , synthetic biology , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel , the fuel ,
I mean , how many saw the victory in `` Jeopardy of Watson . ''
It was a mate .
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that would have .
And I loved this : `` Watson <unk> human ignorance . ''
Jeopardy is not a easy game .
It 's based on human language .
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for all in the mobile phone .
Four years ago , here at TED , Ray Kurzweil and I , we launched a new university called <unk> University .
We teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how you can use to solve the big challenges of humanity .
And every year we asked them to get a company , or a product or service , that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade .
Think about that , the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people .
30 years ago , that would have <unk> <unk> .
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done .
When I think about creating abundance , it does n't mean to create <unk> life for every day of the planet ; it 's about creating a life of possible .
It 's about taking that that 's scarce and make it clear .
You know , the scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
I 'll give you one example .
It 's a story of Napoleon Three of the 1800 .
He 's the kind of the left .
I went to dinner the king of <unk> .
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> , and the same Napoleon , with gold .
But the king of <unk> , ate with aluminum .
You know , the aluminum was the most valuable metal metal on the planet -- it 's worth more than the gold and the webpage .
This reason the tip of the east is aluminum .
You can see , even though aluminum is the interconnectedness of the Earth 's mass , it does n't come like metal metal .
It 's linked for oxygen and <unk> .
But then it came to the <unk> and made it as cheap that we use it as if it was <unk> .
It 's going to get this analogy to the future .
Let 's think about the scarcity of energy .
Ladies and gentlemen , we 're on a planet , for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
They go to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every minutes .
It 's not about scarcity , but it 's about us .
And there 's good news .
This year , for the first time , the cost of the energy energy in India is 50 percent less than the beam of <unk> : A rupees versus 17 rupees .
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year .
Last month , MIT published a study that shows the late decade , in the U.S. parts of the United States , electricity electricity will cost six cents a hour compared to 15 cents a hour compared to 15 cents of the national average .
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water .
Let 's talk about the wars for the water .
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft on the Earth , in 1990 , after it happened to Saturn ?
It was a famous picture . How was it called ?
`` A pale blue dot . ''
Because we live on a planet of water .
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water .
Yeah , <unk> water is saltwater , two percent of it is ice , and they fight for one percent of the water of the planet , but also there 's a hope .
It 's a available technology , not for 10 years , but right now .
It comes to nanotechnology , the crest .
In a conversation with Dean texts this morning , one of the innovators of the <unk> -- I 'd like to share with you , he gave me permission to do it -- his technology called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator .
It 's able to make a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any seawater , <unk> water , a <unk> for less than two cents a liter .
The president of Coke has been told that I 'm going to do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world .
If that 's going well , and I have fully confidence in that this is , Coca-Cola is to implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet .
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that today exists .
And we 've seen it in the mobile .
My God , we 're going to get to 70 percent of the mobile world in the developing world for the end of 2013 .
Think about it , that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in Kenya that the Reagan is 25 years ago .
And , to count with a intelligent phone with Google , has access to more knowledge and information that the president Clinton 15 years ago .
He lives in a world of new information and communications that no one could be predicted .
We better than that , the things that you have , and I have paid tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> , <unk> video , images , images of books and music , <unk> technology now <unk> and lose value value .
Perhaps the best time you get when it looks like the applications in health .
Last month , I had the pleasure to optimize with the <unk> Foundation called the X <unk> <unk> , 10 million dollars .
We 're challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device with the ones that they speak , and because it has A.I you , you can agree , you can get a blood of the finger .
To win it has to make better diagnostics that a patient team team .
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world that there are no doctors , where the load of morbidity is 25 percent of the health workers .
When this device <unk> an RNA virus , or DNA that does n't mean , call the health of health and , in the first place , avoid the pandemic .
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance .
I call it a billion .
The white lines here are the population .
We 've just done the brand of the seven billion .
By the way , the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health .
In 2010 , we had less than two billion people online , connected .
By 2020 , two billion of the Internet users .
Three billion minds never before you heard about the global conversation .
What would these people want these people ?
What are you going to do ? What wishes you are ?
And instead of an economic collapse , we have the greatest economic injection of history .
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy .
And <unk> more health , thanks to the <unk> , of a better education , and because of the use of impressions in 3D and computation in the cloud are more productive than never before .
What can you give three million people of humanity , healthy and productive and productive ?
What about some voices ever before you heard ?
What if we give the oppressed , wherever they 're , a voice to be heard and power to act for the first time ?
What would you take these 3,000 million ?
And if you 're contributions that we ca n't predict ?
Something that I learned with the X Prize is that small equipment , led by their passion with a clear target , you can do extraordinary things -- things that before they could only do the big corporations and governments .
I 'm going to end up sharing a story that I really was excited .
There 's a program that maybe some of you know .
It 's called <unk> .
<unk> at the University of Washington , in Seattle .
It 's a game that people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein .
The folds determines the structure and the functionality .
It 's something very important in the medical research .
And , until now , it was a problem .
They 've played with this college teachers , between others .
Then hundreds of thousands of people come up and started playing .
And it 's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better likely to reverse proteins than the best computers .
Ladies and gentlemen , what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges of the planet .
We have the tools with this exponential technology .
We have the passion of the <unk> of the <unk> .
We have the capital of the <unk> .
And we have 3,000 million minds that we 're going to be used to work on the solution of the big challenges and make what we need to do .
We have a few extraordinary decades .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about a very small idea .
The <unk> of the point of starting .
And as the idea can be explained in a minute , before I give you three examples to do time .
The first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my heroes .
He was here , as you know .
Perhaps they think of it , it 's no longer .
They actually take fish .
And he described one of them as a very <unk> .
It was the tribal .
It became a lot to the 1930s .
Now the fish is in the Red Falcon of the east .
But we 've heard this story a lot of times , about Galapagos and other places , so that does n't have anything special .
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos .
We still think they 're <unk> .
<unk> still say that they 're going to be extinct .
So what happens here ?
The second story , also illustrates another concept , the shift of the waist .
Because I was there in 1971 studying a water in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe , and then I wanted to work in Africa .
I thought it could be <unk> .
I became much with the Sun , and I was convinced that I was not there .
This is my first exhibition to the Sun .
The water was surrounded by unemployed , and , as you can see , from a little mangroves .
There was <unk> about 20 centimeters , the <unk> of black beard .
And the fishing of this translates was very clear and spent for a good moment , so it was taken more from the middle in Ghana .
When I went there 27 years after the amount of fish had gone to half .
It 's going to take five centimeters .
It would be a genetic pressure .
There were no fish .
In a way , they were still happy .
And the fish were still happy to be there .
Or , nothing changed , but everything has changed .
My third story is that I went into the introduction of the fishing fisheries in Southeast Asia .
In the 1970s , you know , it started in <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects .
In the development of the desert , it was imposing the countries who had 100,000 fishermen , <unk> the industrial fisheries .
And this boat , pretty ugly , called <unk> four .
I went to fishing in him , and we did research in the south Sea of China , and , especially , in the Sea of Java .
What we captured it was something <unk> .
<unk> , right now , the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of what we captured was <unk> , other animals that are in the bottom .
And most of the fishes are both tiny spots on a bit of remains , remains that they 're fish of coral reef .
In short , the bottom of the sea came to the deck , and then it was made .
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
In one year , you do a study , and then you start the mall .
The bottom of being a solid coral of soft coral , in this case , to be a <unk> .
This is a dead turtle .
They did n't eat it . They did it because they were dead .
Once we captured a living .
It was still not <unk> .
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food .
This mountain of the remains is what we collect the fishermen every time they 're going to have the fishermen that they never have fish .
But it 's not documented .
We turn the world , but we do n't remember it .
You know , the point of starting , the new level , without remembering what was there .
If you 're looking at this happens something like this .
On the axis , we have good things : biodiversity , lots of <unk> , the <unk> of the water supply .
And that changes the time . It changes because people do things with it .
Every generation to use the images , they get the images to the beginning of their conscious life as the normal , and it travels forward .
The difference is that they perceive loss .
But they do n't perceive the loss that happened before .
You can look at the size of changes .
And at the end , they keep a bit of miserable remains .
And that 's what we want to do now .
We want to keep things that are not , or they 're not what they were .
But you should think that this problem affects people , when societies are willing to kill animals without knowing what they have done to a few generations later .
Because , obviously , an animal that 's very clear , before it 's going to go back , it 's a little bit .
You do n't lose animals .
You lose animals .
And even if this is not a great loss .
With the time , we focus on the big animals , and in a <unk> of great fish .
They become a little bit of , because they take them .
With the time there are a few fishes , but we think that is the point of starting .
And the question is , why do we accept this ?
Well , because we do n't know that it was different .
In fact , a lot of people , scientists , <unk> that it was very different .
And they 're going to do because the evidence presented in a previous way that they would expect to have the evidence .
So for example , the anecdote that some of them present , as a quarter of fish , and I looked like a lot of fish in this area ca n't be used or , because of the general do n't use the scientific scientists , because it 's not `` scientific . ''
So , we have a situation where people do n't know the past , although we lived in <unk> societies , because they do n't rely on the sources of the past .
There 's a huge piece that can be able to be a protected marine area .
Because with the ocean areas , we really consider the past .
It 's <unk> the past people that people ca n't think , because the point of starting is a very low point .
That 's for people who can see a protected marine area , and they can benefit from the vision that provides , which allows you to erase your point of starting .
And what happens with people who ca n't do it because they do n't have access , as the people in the Middle East , for example ?
I think there 's the arts and film maybe you can fill the vacuum . The simulation .
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay Bay .
A long time there were gray whales in the Bay Bay -- 500 years ago .
And you may have to notice that the nuanced and <unk> are like `` Avatar . ''
And if you think about `` Avatar , '' if you think about what people were moved with the film , I 'm going to talk about the story of <unk> , why do you do with the images ?
Because it was something that , in a certain sense .
So my suggestion , the only thing I 'm going to give , is <unk> , to say , `` Avatar II '' under the water .
Thank you very much .
Hi . I 'm Kevin <unk> , the video of YouTube trends , and I look at YouTube videos .
It 's true .
So today we 'll see why the videos are going to make the videos , and what the importance is that .
We all want to be stars : celebrities , singers , films -- when I was younger , that seemed very , very difficult .
But today the web video makes any of us , or of our actions , copper in a part of our world culture .
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk> .
It gets more than 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute .
And , of those , just a little bit of a small percentage , you get lots of visits , and it 's making cultural <unk> .
How does that happen ?
Three things : creators of trends , communities and surprise .
Well , let 's start .
<unk> <unk> : Oh my God , my God .
God !
Whoa !
<unk> , <unk> !
KA : The past year , <unk> <unk> published this video out of his house in the National Park .
In 2010 , it was seen 23 million times .
This graph shows the contents of the eastern summer of the past summer .
It was not going to do a viral video .
I just wanted to share a rainbow .
That 's what you do if it 's called Mountain Mountain <unk> .
There was a lot of videos of nature .
This video was published in January .
So what happened here ?
It was Jimmy .
Jimmy <unk> published this guy that <unk> the video to the popularity .
The creators of trends like Jimmy and interesting things and <unk> and <unk> a broader audience .
RS : It 's Friday , Friday , you have to start Friday . You 're all going to start Friday , the weekend , a week , a week . <unk> , Friday .
`` <unk> . ''
You saw it almost 200 million times this year .
This graph shows the frequency of use .
And the same thing that 's <unk> , this video seemed to have come from nothing .
So what happened this day ?
Well , it was Friday .
And if you ask for those other peaks , they 're also Friday .
But what happened this day , this Friday morning ?
Well , I took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it .
Michael Survey , from <unk> Science , was one of the first people in doing a joke on Twitter on Twitter .
But the important thing is that one person , or a group of <unk> trends , and they share it with a broader audience , accelerating the process .
So , this community of people who share this great inner joke , then start talking about that and do things .
And now there are 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So only in the first seven days , there was a video for each other days .
Unlike entertainment in the 20th century , this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> , or doing something new with it .
`` <unk> Cat '' is an interactive animation with a <unk> music .
So , that 's all .
This year you saw it about 50 million times .
And if you think that that 's weird , you know that there 's an version of three hours that has seen four million times .
We saw this video .
And there 's cats that saw other cats see the video .
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up between the <unk> community .
There was <unk> .
Someone did a version of the old .
And then it was international .
In a sudden , came all a whole community , which did this happen to be a silly joke to something that we all can form part .
Because today we do n't just enjoy , we put them .
Who could have predicted something like this ?
Who could have to be able to see , `` Are you going to go , `` Are you going to go , `` Are you <unk> , or `` <unk> '' ? ''
What did I have been written to be written with this situation ?
In a world that you get two days of video per minute , just the only single thing and unexpected , and it can <unk> the way these things have done .
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a kind of protest that protest against us to cyclists in New York , I 'll admit that I did n't get too interested .
Casey <unk> : I 'm going to make me a <unk> for the <unk> , but often there are obstacles that you 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> the <unk> .
KA : Thank you how to surprise you and his humor , Casey <unk> have to have five million saw , and you know their idea .
So this approach is worth of the whole new way that we do .
And everything leads to a great question .
<unk> <unk> : What does this mean ?
<unk> .
KA : What does this mean ?
The creators , the creative communities of participation , the most unexpected , are features of a new type of media , a new culture , which we all have access , and it 's the audience that defined the popularity .
As I said before , one of the world of the world , Justin Muti , started on YouTube .
Do n't be permission to express their ideas .
Now we 're all a little bit out of our pop culture .
These are not the characteristics of the other media , are barely the other media of the media , but it 's <unk> the entertainment of the future .
Thank you .
This is not a whole story .
It 's a puzzle that is still building .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning the work of a whole life .
It 's a poet , a playwright , a man whose entire life had been killed in the only one of unity and freedom of his country .
Now , you think , when the communist come in <unk> , compared to the fact that his life had been completely in trouble .
The words , for so long women women , right now .
It 's <unk> in the silence .
She died broken for the story .
He 's my grandfather .
I never met him .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story .
My task was not going to stop that that 's been in trouble , and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> , but <unk> .
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn of the <unk> .
My mother , <unk> , had just 18 years old when his father died , and a little <unk> and two little girls .
For her , life had been used to one task , the escape of his family and a new life in Australia .
It was inconceivable for her that I could n't do it .
And then , after four years that challenges the fiction , a boat , a boat , to the sea of fishing boat .
All adults knew the risks .
The biggest fear was the hackers , rape and death .
Like the majority of adults , my mother was wearing a <unk> .
If we hit , first I would have my sister and me , and then she and my grandmother .
My first memories are from that boat , the constant rate of the engine , the <unk> in every wave , and the vast horizon and empty .
I do n't remember the hackers who came several times , but they were <unk> with the courage of the men in our boat , or the engine dying and not being able to walk for six hours .
But I know the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia , and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey was too much for him ; and the first apple I tried , given by the men of the platform .
No apple had the same taste .
After three months in a refugee field , <unk> in Melbourne .
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to make a new life together .
We set up in <unk> , a little bit of <unk> whose population is composed of immigrants .
Unlike the middle suburbs , whose existence I did n't , in <unk> , no sense of the right .
The smells that came from the shops of the world .
And the fragments of English English fragments that had one thing in common : they were starting again .
My mother worked in farms , then in a line of cars , working six days , double turn .
And yet , I found time to study English and get a degree in IT .
We were poor .
All of the dollars they were stored , and they have a extra record in English and mathematics , does n't matter what it was going to be taken , that it was often a new clothing ; it was always a second hand .
Two pairs of half to school , one to hide the holes of the other .
A school uniform , because I had to last six years .
And there was weird and <unk> on the `` eyes <unk> '' and some graffiti , `` Ma , go home . ''
On home , where ?
Something of me are <unk> .
He was buying determination and a voice who said , `` I 'm going to <unk> . ''
My mother , my sister and I would <unk> in the same bed .
My mother was killed every night , but we 're going to tell us about our day and listen to the movements of our grandmother in home .
My mother had nightmares , all of the boat .
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares started to be <unk> .
She opened a computer store , then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business .
And women came up with their stories about men who could n't do the transition , angry and <unk> , and kids were trapped between two worlds .
They looked like subsidies and sponsors .
It was created .
I lived in parallel worlds .
In one , it was the classic Asian student , <unk> with what I 'm going to be in myself .
In the other , I was <unk> in poor lives , <unk> <unk> for violence , the drug abuse and isolation .
But a lot of received help in the years .
And for that job , when I was studying my last year , I gave me the young student of the year .
And I went into a piece of the puzzle of the puzzle to the other , but their edges did n't fit .
So , I 'm going to go up , <unk> <unk> , was right now , refugee and social activist , invited to talk to the sites that I 've never heard , and in houses whose existence was never imagined .
I did n't know the protocols .
I did n't know how to use covered .
I did n't know how to talk about wine .
I did n't know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to give you back to the world and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters finishing the day as it did for almost 20 years , <unk> about the day of every one and <unk> <unk> , the three still in the same bed .
And I told my mom I could n't do it .
I reminded me that I had the same age that she had when she came up to the boat .
`` No , '' had never been a choice .
`` Go , '' he said , `` Do n't be what you do n't . ''
So , I talked about <unk> and education and <unk> them to the marginalized and the birds .
And the more frankly speaking , I was more <unk> to speak .
I met people from all the paths of life , many of them doing what loved , living in the border of possible .
And even though I ended up my assistant , I realized I could n't stay in a great career .
I had to have another piece of the puzzle .
And I realized at the same time that 's good to be a unknown , a half , new in the scene -- and not only it 's good , but it 's something for what I 'm grateful , perhaps a gift of the boat .
Because I 'll be inside it , it can easily mean <unk> the horizons , you can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your province .
He gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that , yes , that the world 's going on , but not the way we fear .
You know , they would n't have been <unk> .
There was a energy there , a <unk> optimism , a rare mix of humility and courage .
So I kept my intuition .
It 's going to take a small group of people who said the motto `` ca n't be done , '' it was a <unk> challenge .
For a year , we did n't have a cent .
By the end of every day , I would make a giant assistant .
It 's going to give them back to the night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant , and we open up .
I took the decision for the United States .
And then one trip .
My gut again .
Three months later I had moved , and the adventure continued .
Before I end , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up in one time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered .
Life was n't changed for centuries .
His father died shortly after she was born .
The mother grew alone .
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother would beat him .
No support of her husband , caused a half to the <unk> and take the cause , and a lot more <unk> caused when won .
It ca n't happen to be wrong .
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel hotel when she died , 1,000 kilometers , in Melbourne .
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw the other side .
I knew I had come to say that I had come to say .
My mother called minutes after .
Days later , we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> , and we sat around his consortium .
We have stories , and we make sure that we were still with it .
On the night , he came up and told us that I had to close to him .
My mother asked us to get her hand .
I asked him to the narrator , `` Why your hand is hot , and the rest of the body is cold ? ''
`` Because you have taken his hand from the morning , '' he said .
`` Do n't have <unk> . ''
If there 's a nerve in our family , that runs through women .
Because we were , and how life formed us , now we can see that the men who had come to our lives would have frustrated .
The defeat would have <unk> .
Now I want to have my own children , and I ask me about the boat .
Who could desire that for yes ?
However , I fear the privilege of how easy , the right .
I can give you a little bit in their lives , a brave hand in every wave , the constant rate of the engine , the vast horizon that does n't guarantee anything ?
I do n't know .
But if I could give them and see them except , I would .
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today , in the fourth or fifth row .
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago .
I was in the desert , under the sky rotates , with <unk> singer Ali .
We were a conversation of how nothing has changed from the age of the old Indian opera , <unk> .
In those days when the birth of us wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky .
Now we do it with aircraft .
In that time , when <unk> , the great Indian warrior , I had thirst , taking a rainbow and with a <unk> to the ground , got water .
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines .
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had been replaced to the magic .
And that 's a lot of me .
Every time I felt a little bit more .
I 'm going to tell me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a little bit if I did n't have the camera , if I could n't give my friends .
I looked like the technology had to allow the magic , not kill .
In a little girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> .
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing .
It became a golden door to a world full of images and <unk> in my imagination .
I had the feeling that the mobile and the chambers of luxury and the cameras avoid that we 're going to engage .
Let 's get our inspiration .
So I went to me , I went down to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic , instead of poison .
<unk> books since 16 years .
So when I saw the iPad , I saw a device of storytelling that we can connect to the readers of the entire world .
You can know how we took the book .
Where are we .
They bring the text with the image , the animation , the sound and touch .
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk> .
But , what do we do that ?
I 'm about to launch <unk> , an interactive application for iPad .
He says , `` puts your fingers on every light . ''
And so -- he says , `` This box belongs to -- I write my name .
And so I get a character of the book .
In several times , I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to the GPS -- that comes to me .
My little little little little bit very excited with all these possibilities .
I 've talked about a lot of magic .
And I do n't mean , and I do n't mean , but that magic of childhood , to those ideas that we 're going to get out of children .
So , for some reason , fireflies in a jar , I was always done .
So , here , we have to look at the iPad to liberate fireflies .
And , indeed , you light your way on the way of the book .
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little bit of a <unk> galaxy .
So here , every book and every single world is turned into a <unk> that I went to this magic device , within the device .
And this opens a map .
In the whole book , there 's always been maps , but they have been static maps .
This is a map that grows , <unk> and guide them over the rest of the book .
In certain dots of the book , it 's also reveals .
Now I 'm going to go into .
Another important thing for me is to create Indian content and contemporary .
These are the <unk> .
We 've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> , but , how many people were out of India , they know their Indian friends , <unk> ?
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of DDT for millennia , in a old , <unk> book .
So we 're bringing them back in a regular child .
In a story that it 's about today , like the environmental crisis .
And , talking about the environmental crisis , one of the problems of the last 10 years , has been that children have been involved in the world , they have n't gone to the outside world .
But now with mobile technology , we can take our children to the natural world with their technology .
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out to the outside , take the camera or the iPad , and collect images of different natural objects .
As a child , I had a lot of collections : with sticks , stones , <unk> and shells .
For some reason kids do n't do .
So to reclaim this ritual ritual , you have to go out and , in one chapter , <unk> a picture of a flower and then <unk> .
In another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then correct .
In this way , it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web .
A child of London put a picture of a flashlight and says , `` Oh , I saw a rifle . ''
A child of India says , `` I saw a monkey . ''
And it 's created this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have gone out .
Inside of the measurements of connection between magic , Earth and technology are many possibilities .
In the next book , we 've got an interaction in which you come up with the iPad and the video on and it actually looks like a group of two cartoons that appear about the plants inside the house .
On a moment the screen is full of the leaves .
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> for power to read the rest of the book .
We 're going to go into a world that the forces of nature has been going to the technology and the magic and technology are close to another .
It 's <unk> the energy of the Sun .
We 're approaching our children and ourselves in the natural world and that magic , joy and child love that we sit through a simple story .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> fail .
And I think , really , that the most important thing that we let 's listen to the patients .
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a principal of listening .
And not in a very scientific way , she raised a small cup of coffee or you and asked patients , family and known , what happens ? ''
How can we help ?
And we tend to think , that this is one of the biggest problems for what all , or not all , but most of the projects of <unk> fail , because we stopped listening .
This is my <unk> . It 's something very simple .
It 's got a shower .
Every morning , I get to me .
And yes , I have a challenge as you can see .
I got the challenge to get to 95 kilograms .
But it 's so simple , that every time I connect to me , send my information to Google Health .
And my doctor 's doctor has access to him as well . So he can see what my problem is my weight problem , not at the same time that they need to serve <unk> , or some urge that style , but it looked back .
But there 's another thing .
As some of you know , I have more than four Twitter followers .
So every morning I connect to my <unk> , and before you go back to my car , people start talking to me : <unk> , today I think you need a light lunch .
That 's the best thing that can happen , because it 's pressure of the peers used to help patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also for the patients stop smoking .
On the other hand , it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs , and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health .
From the next week to be available .
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device .
And people can be able to be able to take their blood pressure , <unk> his doctor , and share with others , for 100 dollars .
This is the point where the patients take a position , they 're going to get the control , and it will be captains of his own boat , but we can also help care of health care because the challenges that we face , as a shot of the costs of <unk> attention , <unk> .
We 're simple techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team .
And they can do it with techniques like this , but also by this .
And one of the things we did like to share with you .
We all have the <unk> of navigation .
Maybe we have to get them into our cell cell .
We know perfectly where the ATMs are in <unk> .
Where are all the <unk> .
And of course , we can find a quick food chains .
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient ?
We asked , but no one knew .
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this moment .
What we did was to do is to do this thing in the Netherlands .
We created a website , and we asked the audience that : If you look at a <unk> , please <unk> , where , and when it 's open , because they 're open , because sometimes you open to the office of office and others are closed .
And more than 10,000 <unk> has been introduced in the Netherlands .
The next step was looking for the application for that .
And we made an app for the iPad .
We created an app for <unk> , reality , to find these <unk> .
And every time they 're in the city of <unk> and someone will be killed , you can use your iPhone , and the weeks of the next weeks I would use his phone phone in Microsoft to find the closest <unk> , which can save lives .
And from today , I wanted to do this , not just like <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
And we wanted to <unk> the world level .
We 're <unk> all of the colleagues in the world , in other universities , for us to help us find , work and act like a center for the Web of <unk> around the world .
Every time you 're on vacation and somebody else can be a relative or someone in front of you , you can find it .
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us survive these <unk> .
They could be a message services , or people of telephony , for example , to see if the <unk> is still in its place .
Please help us care and not just improve health , but to take the control of it .
Thank you very much .
I 'm here to share this photograph .
Or is it <unk> .
Because , of course , it 's photographs that you ca n't take with their cameras .
My interest for the photograph is woke up with my first digital camera to 15 years .
I joined my passion before the drawing , but it was a little bit different because the camera would use the camera , the process was in planning .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends up when it 's going to run out .
For me , the photograph I had more to see with being in the right place , at the right time .
I looked like anyone could do it .
And so I wanted to create something different , a process that I would start to press it .
So we think about this : a building in a very <unk> road .
But it 's got a unexpected thing .
And , in spite of it , it keeps a level of the Renaissance .
Or photos like these -- dark and colorful and colorful target , but with the common target to keep the computer level .
And when I say , I mean <unk> .
Because , of course , it 's not something that can <unk> , but I always want it to be captured in a way as a photograph .
So we 're going to have to think about a moment to discover the trick .
It has more to see with capture an idea that I can capture a moment .
But what is the trick that makes them seem real ?
Are the details or colors ?
Would you get the light ?
What is the illusion that creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective .
But the end is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface .
It 's actually not about whether it 's realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the ones are very simple .
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three objects perfectly likely , something that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world .
But they 're born in a certain way you can create something that still looks like three-dimensional ; as if it existed .
But , at the same time , we know it does n't exist .
So , we think of the brain because the brain does n't get the fact that that does n't have sense .
And I see the same process to combine the photographs .
It really has to combine different realities .
And the things that make a picture , I think that they do n't even think , the things that we do in our everyday life .
But by combine photographs , it 's very important to think , because of the other way something you see wrong .
So I 'd like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to go to achieve realistic outcomes .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective .
Secondly , the photos combined must have the same kind of light .
And these two images are getting up with these requirements ; they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light .
The third point is to do the principle and the end of the various images with a perfect deal .
It has to be impossible to see where the image is the image .
This is another example .
I could think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part of it is nothing .
But this image is completely composed by photographs of different places .
In the personal person , I think it 's easier to create a place that we find because you do n't need to put the ideas in the ideas that has in your head .
But it takes a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew that I had several months to <unk> , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle .
For example , the fish was captured on a fishing journey .
The coast are a different location .
The <unk> was captured on a rock .
And yes , I even did the house at the top of the island , so it looks more old .
So to get a realistic result , I think it 's missing planning .
You always start with a sketch , an idea .
Then we have to combine the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well .
If you make a good job to take the photos , the result can be very beautiful and a very realistic time .
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
Thank you .
I 'm going to start showing showing a slide about technology , very boring .
Please .
It 's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine .
I 'm not interested to show you the details , but the general way .
It 's about a analysis that we 've been doing about the power of the pancreas <unk> versus the power of the local area .
The interesting thing about this is that this , as many other people that we 're going to see , it 's a straight species in scale .
In other words , every step here represents a order of magnitude on the performance of performance .
I 'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves .
Here 's something strange .
And I 'm going to talk about .
Please turn the lights .
It 's more intensity because writing about paper .
Why is we going to build technological curves in <unk> ?
The answer is that if I draw in a regular curve in which , say , these are the years , or some unit of time , and this would be any extent of the technology that I wanted to draw , the diagram would see something ridiculous .
It would be something like this .
It does n't say a lot .
But if you plot , for example , some other technology , like the transportation , a very silly line , you would see a straight line .
But if it happens something like this , a qualitative change .
If the technology of the transport , <unk> as fast as you know , we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
But it does n't happen to that rhythm .
There 's no difference in the history of technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years to see orders of magnitude .
The question I want to ask is -- if you look at these exponential curves , we see that they do n't follow forever .
It 's not possible to support this very fast change as well .
It would take one of two things .
Or it 's going to turn in a typical line , like this until it comes to something completely different , or maybe I 'm going to do something like this .
That 's all it can happen .
I 'm optimistic , so I think maybe something like this .
So , we would be in the middle of a transition .
In this line , we 're in a transition of what used to be the world , a new way .
So what I 'm trying to ask , and let 's wonder , is , what is that new way of the world ?
How new is the world ?
The transition seems very , very <unk> if we 're engaged in it .
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
This is a conference that people talks about the future , and we see that the future is still the year 2000 .
That 's all we see .
In other words , the future has separated , year after year , throughout my life .
But I think it 's because we feel that something is happening .
It 's about a transformation . We can feel .
And we know that it does n't have a lot of meaning to think about 30 or 50 years , because it 's all so different to extrapolate what we 're doing today has no sense .
So I want to talk to you about how it could be , how could that transition that we experience .
But to do that , I 'll have to talk a little bit of things that do n't have a lot to do with technology and computer .
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things .
The size of time I 'd like to do is the time of life on Earth .
I think this image has a sense if you look at every billion years .
So , we go back about two million years old when the Earth was a great rock rock with a lot of chemicals that would be around .
If we look at the way that we have these chemicals , we give them a sense of how things happened .
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA , and I 'm going to tell you a simple version of this , and it is that , at that moment , there was a little bit of <unk> of oil with all sorts of chemical recipes in its inside .
Some of those oil spills was a particular combination of chemicals that they were using materials from the outside , and so they grew up .
And they started it .
In a certain sense , those were the most primitive cell forms ; those of oil seals .
But those tweets were n't living , in the current sense , because every one of them had a random recipe of chemicals .
And every time you 've been divided to <unk> an unequal distribution of the chemicals .
And so every electron was a little bit different .
In fact , it turns out that some way you 're going to be better to the hour of adding the chemical chemicals -- growing more , more chemicals and divided more .
They 're going to live more time , they were more represented .
It was a form of life , and chemistry , very simple , but things are really interesting when these tweets learned the trick of abstraction .
In some ways that we do n't understand very well that we were learned to store information .
They learned to hold information , which was the recipe of the cell , in a special chemist called DNA .
In other words , <unk> in this evolution of writing , a writing system that allowed them to support what they were to replicate .
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have gone stable since it evolved billion years ago .
Our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same code writing .
In fact , every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
And one of the things I did only for fun -- we can write things with this code .
Here I have a 100 <unk> of the white powder that I try to hide the safety people of the airport .
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA , and it 's <unk> 10 to 22 times .
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card , I have a lot of for all of them in this way , for every person in the world , and it 's here .
If it was a <unk> , it would have put it into a virus , and it would have spread it for the room .
What was the next step ?
Writing DNA was a interesting step .
This was what these cells were happy to a billion years .
But then there was another great step in which things were very different , and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information with the communities of cells .
I do n't know if you know , but bacteria can exchange DNA .
So , for example , evolved the resistance to antibiotics .
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria , and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate .
This media gave place that they would grow communities that , in a way , they were together with that , and we had a synergy .
In that way to be involved or failed them together , or that if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community , and they were <unk> by evolution .
And the tipping point happened when these communities came out , in fact , came together and decided to write all the recipe of the community in a DNA chain .
The next stage for life took other billion years ago .
And in that stage , we have <unk> communities , communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism .
In fact , we are a regular community .
We have a lot of cells that they do n't use alone .
The skin cell does n't do without heart 's heart , or the one of the muscles , or the brain , etc .
So , these communities evolved and become more interesting levels that the cell , something we call an organism .
The next level happened within these communities .
These started <unk> information .
And to build very special structures that did n't do more than processing information in community .
It 's the neural structures .
The neurons are the devices that causes the information that those cell communities built .
In fact , they started within the community to be <unk> structures , understanding and transmit the information .
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism , and not at the period of evolutionary time .
So , a organism could , for example , learn to not a certain fruit because I knew it wrong and got sick the last time I ate it .
That could happen for the life of an organism , because before they had built these structures of information processing that for the evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years per death of people who ate that fruit .
So the fact that the fact that the nervous system built these structures of information , enormously the evolutionary process .
Because evolution could now happen to an individual .
It could happen in time to learn .
But then , of course , the individuals found the trick of communication .
So , for example , the most likely version we know is human language .
If we think about it , it 's an amazing invention .
I have a very complex idea an idea , in the head .
I 'm sitting here by a little bit of <unk> and , hopefully , building a similar idea and <unk> , in their head , in their head , and it takes some analogy with mine .
But we took something very complicated we become , in sound of sound , and we produce something very complicated in another brain .
That allows us to start working as an organism .
In fact , as humanity , we 've started to run abstractions .
Now we went through a similar research to the city organisms , <unk> our record , show and information processing .
For example , the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
The telephony , the computer , the computer tape , the aurochs , so on . They are the specialized mechanisms that we now build that information .
And that brings us to something much bigger , faster and able to evolve more than we did before .
Now evolution can happen to happen .
You know , you saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> that produced some evolution with the <unk> program , to our eyes .
And now we 've accelerated the scales of time again .
The first time of the story that I was told was taken a billion years .
The next time , the nervous system and the brain , took about hundreds of millions of years .
The next thing , the language and they took less than a million years .
And the next thing , like the electronics , it seems just a few decades .
So the process came back , I guess that <unk> is the right word to name something that reduces their own pace of change .
The more changes , faster .
And I think that 's what we look at this explosion of the curve .
We see that the process came back .
But I 'm doing my life designing computers , and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would n't be possible without the recent computer breakthroughs .
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible to me design for me .
I do n't know that every transistor does in that machine machine .
There are billions .
Instead , with <unk> designers , we think about a level of abstraction , we put it on the machine and the machine with that makes something that before I could n't , it gets much more far and faster than never before .
In fact , sometimes they have a tool that we do n't even understand well .
A particularly interesting method that I 've been using it , is evolution itself .
We put inside the machine a evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microbes .
And for example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program from a random sequence of instructions .
Do you say , `` Please computer , you can run a hundred million of random instructions ?
You could play these images of random instructions , to play all those programs , and take those more people who are going to be able to do ? ''
In other words , I define what I want .
So let 's say , I want to talk to numbers , to put a simple example .
So , we find the programs that are closer to other numbers .
Of course , it 's a little bit likely to have a random sequences of instructions , <unk> numbers , so none of them did .
But , luckily , he could put two numbers in the right order .
And I said , `` computer , could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task ?
They 're going to get those and <unk> the rest .
And now , they 're going to say that the best numbers of the numbers .
And let 's go back to <unk> a process of analog to sex . ''
Let 's take two programs , that <unk> children , and that the children would be <unk> the properties of both programs .
So we get a new generation of programs of programs that had a little more successful .
And we say , `` Please do the process . ''
Let 's go back again .
We 're going to get some mutations .
And it 's trying to get back to another generation .
Well , every generation takes a few milliseconds .
So , I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes , or , in a little bit , a few hours .
In the end , we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfect .
In fact , it 's a lot more efficient programs that I could have written to hand .
If I look at those programs I ca n't say how they work .
I 've tried to analyze it to see how they work .
They 're dark , strangers .
But they 're going to do it .
In fact , I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did .
In fact , their lives depend on it .
Once he was going on a 747 with a <unk> , and he gets a card and says , `` Look this .
He says , <unk> , has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a safe flight . Do n't make you feel quiet ? ''
We know that the engineering processes do n't work very well when they become complicated .
So we started to depend on computers to make design design .
And that allows us to produce much more complex things that makes the normal engineering .
However , we do n't understand all of the choices that we have .
In that sense , it 's going to do .
Now we use those programs to do much faster computers and so we can run these programs much more quickly .
Or , it feeds .
The thing is going to be faster and so I think it seems so <unk> .
Because all of these technologies are gone .
We 're going to get it .
And we 're at a moment of analog to the entrepreneurial organisms when they become a city .
We 're the decency and we ca n't understand what the hell we 're creating .
We 're at the tipping point .
But I think something about us .
I think it would be very arrogant from our part of our part of evolution .
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is going to come .
But now it comes the lunch , and I think I 'll stop here before I 'm going to be <unk> .
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change .
And I think this starts with a doctor , and that 's me .
And I 've made the time enough to allow me to give me a part of my fake shock on that .
Before I 'm trying to do the issue of my talk , let 's talk a little bit of baseball .
Why do n't you ?
We 're close to the end , this is the World Bank .
We love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of surprising stats .
There are hundreds of statistics .
It 's going to go out `` <unk> the rules . '' talks about the statistics and use them to form a great team of baseball .
I 'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you know it .
It 's called average <unk> .
And we talked about 300 , of a <unk> that <unk> 300 .
That means that <unk> bat , three of 10 times .
That means to launch the ball to the field of play without being trapped , and that anyone who 's going to take them to the first base , I do n't get time , and the second base being done .
Three of 10 attempts .
You know how it 's called a <unk> of 300 in the <unk> .
Well , really good , maybe the team of the stars .
You know how they call a baseball baseball .
By the way , that 's somebody who 's 10 strokes , you get four .
<unk> -- like the Great Ted Williams , the last player of the Federal League of <unk> on a <unk> season .
Now let 's put this to my world of medicine , where I feel much more comfortable , or maybe less awkward , after what I 'm telling today .
Suppose they have Hyderabad , and they 're attracted to a surgeon that has also a record record in <unk> .
It does n't work , right ?
Now suppose they live in a place , and a wanted to have two <unk> arteries and his family 's family , it 's called a cardiologist whose record was in <unk> is 200 .
But , you know something ?
She 's getting better .
It 's been <unk> .
This is not working .
But I 'll ask you .
What do you believe that you should be the average of a heart surgeon of a heart surgeon or differences , from a nurse or a <unk> <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine is that none of medicine is going to be a good surgeon , a medical doctor .
What we do , however , is they send to the world , and I 'm diagnosed with the mandate to be perfect .
That never , never , you 're going to make a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it well .
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school .
I was a Hindu student .
Once , a partner in high school said that Brian Sachs Sachs , to a blood test .
Perhaps .
<unk> in my small <unk> , in the mayor of nurses in Toronto , not far away here .
And I learned all of memory .
In my kind of anatomy , I 'm going to tell you the origin and the muscle work , the <unk> of every artery that 's coming out of the name , the visible standard , and not usual .
And I even know the possible diagnosis of how to embrace the <unk> <unk> .
And as much more and more knowledge .
And I was very good ; I graduated with you .
And <unk> school school with the impression that if you 're going to get all everything , and it would know everything , and the most possible , close to the everything , because I 'm going to get rid of the mistakes .
And it worked for a time , until I met the <unk> lady .
I was resident in a college hospital here , in Toronto , when they brought the lady in the emergency lady where I was working .
At the time , I was born to the mall .
And when an emergency emergency room , I played a cardiologist .
And they report to the chief of residents .
When I saw the <unk> lady , I was a lot .
I heard a <unk> sound .
And when the <unk> , I heard a <unk> sound in both sides , what I 'm going to have a heart heart failure .
In these conditions , the heart leaves to work and , instead of pump the blood forward , the blood is going to the lungs , these <unk> , and that 's why there 's a hard to breathe .
And it was n't difficult to diagnose .
I did , and I started working on the treatment that would give him .
And I gave them up and medications to alleviate the pressure in your heart .
I gave them <unk> , pills , so that I could remove liquid .
And in an hour or two , she started to feel better .
And I sat very well .
And there was when I made the first mistake ; he sent her home .
In fact , I made two more mistakes .
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents .
I did n't get the phone , and I did what I should have done , that was going to call my boss and <unk> with him to see it .
And if my boss would have seen , I would have been able to give up the information information .
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
Maybe I did n't want to be a resident that I would have constant attention .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibilities , that could take care of my patients without even contact my boss .
The second mistake I made was worse .
When they send her home , I did n't give attention to a voice in my inside that I was saying , `` Sachs , is n't a good idea . Do n't do it . ''
In fact , I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that I 'm going to take a <unk> lady , `` Do you think it 's right if it 's going to your house ? ''
And the nurse thought , and then he said , `` Yes , I think I 'm good . ''
I remember that as it was yesterday .
So , it was called the high , and the ambulance with the ambulance were taken home .
And I went back to the hospital room .
The rest of that day , I had a bad deal on the stomach .
But I kept my job .
In the end of the day , they 're going to stop the hospital and walked into the parking lot , where I was my car to go home . At that moment , I did something I do n't do .
It happened for the emergency service service .
And there 's another nurse , not that I 'm going to take out of the <unk> lady before , but another . He told me three words , those three words that most emergency doctors doctors .
Other specialists , they fear , but there 's a <unk> <unk> , and it is that we see the <unk> patients .
The three words are : You know ?
`` Did you remember the patient who sent her home ? ''
I asked the other nurse with total <unk> .
`` Well she went back , '' with the same tone of voice .
She was good .
But I went back and the edge of death .
In a hour of time to have come to her home , after I gave him the high , he suffered a collapse and his family called irrigation ; the United States brought them into emergency pressure with a blood pressure of 50 kilometers of <unk> , which means a severe shock .
You just breathe and was blue .
The emergency staff would put all their resources .
They gave drugs to raise blood pressure .
And they put a artificial inheritance .
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord .
I had a mix of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive therapy , and waiting against all hope that 's going to stop .
And in the two or three days , it was obvious that never <unk> .
He had a permanent brain damage .
The family came together .
And in eight or nine days , it was <unk> what was happening .
And in ninth day , he was going to go . The lady <unk> , wife , mother and grandmother .
They 're going to say that they never blame the names of those who die .
That was my first experience .
The few weeks , I 'm going to get me through it , and I experienced for the first time the shame of shame that exists in our medical culture , and I felt only , isolated , without to feel that healthy shame because you ca n't <unk> with your colleagues .
You do it and never more make that error .
It 's that shame that leaves a teaching .
Shame 's shame that I 'm talking about is what makes us feel very bad .
It 's what tells us not that what we did was wrong , but we 're bad .
And that felt .
And it was n't for my boss ; he was a <unk> .
I talked to the family , and I 'm sure we 're going to make the things , and I did n't tell me the things that I did n't get to me .
And I kept telling those questions .
Why did n't I ask my boss ? Why did he sent her home ?
And in my worst times , why did I did a bad mistake ?
Why I chose medicine ?
Little little of that feeling was <unk> .
And I started to feel better .
And in a cloudy day , the sky turned out , and finally , the sun , and I wondered if I 'd feel better again .
And I did a deal with me that if you 're going to get the efforts to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect to do more mistakes , would take these voices .
And so it was .
I went back to work .
But it was going to happen .
Two years later , it was , in the emergency department department in a London hospital in Toronto , and I got a <unk> man with a pain on the throat .
I was very busy .
And he walked here .
I looked at her throat , I was a little bit of <unk> .
It was <unk> and he sent her home .
But as he went to the door , I went to the next door .
Two days later , when I came to do my change , my boss asked to talk to me in his office .
And I made the three words : I remember you ?
Remember the patient who saw a pain on the throat ?
Well he went back and did n't have a <unk> <unk> .
He had a mortal disease called <unk> .
You can look at Google . It 's an infection , not about the throat , but it 's a higher ice , and that can cause the closing of those tracks .
He , luckily , did n't die .
It 's been antibiotics for <unk> , and they recovered the few days .
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> , and I went back and went back to work , until it happened again and again , and again .
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn , I did n't have any exist .
And it 's a great effort , especially working in a hospital , because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time .
But in both cases , I was not sent home and I do n't think it 's been an awful bit .
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation .
Also , an X-ray of the kidneys , but it turned out normal . A colleague who was checking the patient , a certain sensitivity in the bottom right morning and called the surgeon .
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea .
It was liquid to <unk> and asked my colleague that I would take it .
He looked at it and notice some sensitivity in the bottom bottom right , called the surgeon .
Both of them were diagnosed and they were infected .
But every case I 'm going to get me to me , I 'm written with me .
But I 'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise , and as a lot of colleagues say , is a fan .
The most meaningful have been over the last five years .
Only , embarrassed and support .
And here 's the problem : If I ca n't go back and talk about my mistakes , if I ca n't find the <unk> that really tells me what really happens , how can I share this with my colleagues ?
How do I teach you this to do this for the same mistakes ?
If I would go back to a place like this , I would n't have an idea of what you think about me .
When was the last time you listened to somebody talking about failure , after failure , after failure ?
Of course , in one party , you hear about the mistakes of other doctors , but you wo n't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
And if I knew and my colleagues also , that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg , believe me that I would have difficulties on the eyes .
This is the system we have .
The total denial of mistakes .
It 's the system that there are two positions , which they make mistakes , and the ones that they ca n't sleep and the ones that they have a lot of outcomes , and those who have great outcomes .
And it 's almost like a strong reaction , as antibodies that they start to attack that person .
We have the idea that if you try to make people who make mistakes , we get a safe system .
But that brings two problems .
In 20 years , it 's about spread and journalism , I 've done a personal study of a bad doctor , and medical mistakes to learn how possible , since the first article I wrote for the Stone Toronto to my program , `` White <unk> , `` White <unk> . ''
And what I learned is that the mistakes are ubiquitous .
We work on a system where the mistakes are happening every day , in which one of every 10 drugs , <unk> in the hospital are wrong , or <unk> is not right . In a system where the infections is increasingly , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
In this country , they die 12,000 Canadian medical mistakes .
The U.S. Institute in America set up 100,000 .
In both cases , it 's about <unk> <unk> , because we 're not <unk> the problem as we should .
And so they 're things .
A system where knowledge is stored every two or three years , and we do n't get it .
The sleep sleep .
And we ca n't get rid of it .
We have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with pain pain .
Now , let 's take the same patient with a pain in the chest , it comes to <unk> with eyes <unk> and <unk> to alcohol and , all of a sudden , my story was <unk> .
It 's not the same story .
I 'm not a robot ; I do n't do things equal .
And my patients are not cars . They do n't get their symptoms in the same way .
All of this , the mistakes are inevitable .
So , if we take the system as we were taught , and we remove all the people to be likely to error , good , no one .
And so people do n't want to talk about their most severe cases ?
In my program , `` <unk> white , white art , '' is already a client to say , `` This is my worst mistake . '' I would say everyone to the head of the heart surgery : `` This is my worst mistake , '' blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah , blah blah blah , blah blah , blah blah
And their students are <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> the head and they start to tell their stories .
They want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
<unk> can say , `` Look , I do n't do the same mistake . ''
They need a context where we can do it .
They need a <unk> medical culture .
And it starts with a medical doctor .
The key doctor is human , you know human , you know , and it 's not proud of their mistakes , but it 's willing to learn from what happened to teach others .
Learning their experiences with them .
It 's support for those who talk about their mistakes .
We would give the mistakes of other people , not with the intention of <unk> , but in a loving way and support for everyone 's benefit .
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings go through the system , and when this happens , they make mistakes once when .
My name is Brian Sachs .
I 'm a <unk> doctor .
I 'm a human .
And I feel a lot of it , and I 'm planning to learn something that can transmit others .
I do n't know what about me , but I can live with that .
And let me conclude with three personal words , I remember .
Do you know how many decisions take a day ?
You know how much we choose a week ?
I recently did a survey to more than 2,000 people , and the average amount of choices that says to pick a half American American .
It does n't do a lot , in a research of research to a group of companies .
The researchers used the different tasks of the other tasks , and the time we 're going to be able to make decisions related to those tasks .
They found that , in average , <unk> jobs per week .
Naturally , every work included a lot of <unk> .
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less .
Only 12 percent required an hour or more than their time .
Now think about their choices .
Do you know how many they are being used to the <unk> category , and how many of a hour ?
How does the way they make those decisions ?
Now , I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of today , to pick up with the fuel of options .
I want to talk about the problem and a few possible solutions .
As I talk about this , I 'm going to ask you about a few questions , and I need to know their responses .
When you do a question , as I 'm a blind , raise your hand just if you want to burn calories .
In the other way , when you do a question , if you do a question , if your answer is positive , please give a <unk> .
And now my first question of the day : Are you ready to hear about the problem of the waste of options .
Thank you .
This is a graduate student at Stanford University , <unk> this low level , very high , at least in that time was very sophisticated .
It was called <unk> .
It was almost like going to a success park .
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and Yemen , more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water water , and this was when we were <unk> water .
I loved go to that store , but I asked me , why never buy anything ?
This is the shelf oil .
They had more than 75 different classes , including those who were in a sealed box that came from the Federal trees .
Once I decided to visit the manager , and I asked him , `` Is it right this strategy to offer all these choices ? ''
He set up the buses full of the <unk> that came up every day , usually with their cameras .
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> . This is the <unk> .
Apparently .
They had a different classes .
It was <unk> , right to the entry of the store .
We put it out of six tastes , or a different tastes , and we looked at two things : First , what if people were willing to stop going to try to try to be able to stop ?
More people were stopped when 24 percent , that when there was just six , 40 percent .
We also looked at what it was more likely to buy a jar of shooting .
Here we find the opposite effect .
And so they stopped when there was 24 , only three percent came to buy a button .
So I had six , we saw that 30 percent , we saw that 30 percent .
If we do the calculations , people had six times more likely to buy if they were six .
Well , let 's decide that we do n't buy , you 're probably good , you 're going to be able to preserve the <unk> , but it turns out that the problem of the fuel of choices makes us in good good decisions .
We decided to do n't decide , even when we do n't get it .
Now the issue of the day : financial savings .
I 'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we look at the decisions about savings savings for the retirement of a million Americans , between a million American plans .
We were interested to see if the number of funds are available for retirement plans , the <unk> program , <unk> people to save for the future .
And we discovered that I really had a correlation .
We had <unk> plans that were coming from two , to Charlie choices .
We found that the biggest one number of funds used , there were less participation .
So , if you look at the extreme , we see that in our plans to use two funding , the rate of participation was 70 percent , not as high as you wanted .
And in the plans that they did about 60 funds , the rate of participation went to the '60s .
It turns out that even if you wanted to participate in to participate , when there are more options , even in that case , there are the <unk> consequences .
So , for those who decided to participate in , how much the number of choices , more people are <unk> by avoid the actions or the investment funds .
We were more willing to have more choices , they were more willing to invest in market market market .
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we 're going to do to optimize the financial well-being .
In the previous decade , we 've seen three major unintended consequences of the more and more possibilities .
The most likely thing is that they 're going to make the decision , that the <unk> even when this is going into the interest .
It 's more likely to take the worst decisions , in finance and health .
They 're more likely to pick things less likely to pick up , even likely to go better .
The main reason is that we 're going to be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> , mustard , serene , and we 're not able to do the calculations to compare , <unk> and pick out that amazing show .
Now , I want to tell you about four simple techniques that we 've done , in a way or another , in different research , so that you can test in their business .
The first is , <unk> .
You 've heard it before , but has never been more more than today , which is less .
People are always upset when I say , `` <unk> . ''
It 's worried about losing space in the <unk> .
But actually what we 're looking at each time more and more is that if you decides to cut , you get to get rid of strange soft choices , there will be an increase in sales , <unk> the costs , there 's a better experience in the election .
When I 'm going to say , `` Dear '' in 26 different types of <unk> and <unk> , you saw a rise of 10 percent sales .
When the New Yorkers , I looked like the products for some of cats that are less sold , you have to spread it in 65 percent , for two causes -- bigger sales and lower costs .
You know , the supermarkets of today , on average , they have 45 products .
In a grocery store , they have about 100,000 products .
But the world 's bigger store in the current world is <unk> , and it takes just <unk> products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
In the world of financial savings , I think , one of the best examples that have come out about how to drive better choices , the <unk> program .
All the employees of Harvard are <unk> automatically to a heart of life .
They really want to pick up , they 're offering 20 funding , not 300 or more .
You know that often people say , `` I do n't know as cut .
All of these are important choices . ''
The first thing I do is to ask the employees , `` Tell me the differences that are among those choices .
And if your employees ca n't tell the word , you ca n't make your clients . ''
This afternoon , before I started this session , I was talking to Gary .
He told me that it would be willing to offer people from this audience , a vacation on the most beautiful road in the world .
Here , a description .
I want you to read it .
I 'm going to leave a few seconds to read it , and then I want you to take a applause if you 're ready to take the supply of Gary .
( Three applause ) Okay . Anybody who 's ready to accept the supply .
Are n't more more ?
Well , I 'm going to show you something more .
You knew there was a trick .
Who is ready for that journey ?
I think I really have to hear more hands .
All right .
In reality , you had more information in the first round , that in the second , but I can <unk> and say they thought that the second time was more real .
Because the images were doing more real .
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the problem of the brain .
And so people understand the differences between choices , they have to understand the consequences of every choice , and the consequences must be a very mild way , very concrete .
Why do people spend 15 percent more than 30 percent more on average when you use your credit cards or credit , which when it 's used to be effective ?
Because it does n't seem real money .
It turns out to do more real , it can be a very positive tool for people to save more .
We made a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , about <unk> <unk> that worked in <unk> , these people were in a meeting where they were going to be taken into a <unk> plan .
At that meeting , which is exactly as a little bit of a little bit , we did a little bit .
So what we added was that we 're going to bring into the positive things that would think about their lives if they were more money .
With this <unk> , there was an increase in the 20 percent of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put into their savings savings , four percent .
The third technique is <unk> .
We can run more categories than choices .
For example , this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines .
We saw that in the <unk> , <unk> , the exhibit of magazines , the exhibit of magazines can be from <unk> different types to <unk> .
But , you know ?
Because the classification tells me how to do it .
These are two of these are two of the jewelry .
One is called `` <unk> '' and the other , `` <unk> . ''
If you think of the left is <unk> and the one on the right , it 's <unk> , give a <unk> .

If you think of the left is <unk> and the one on the right , it 's <unk> , give a <unk> .
Well , something else .
It turns out it 's right .
The one of the left is <unk> and on the right is <unk> . But , you know something ?
It 's completely useless .
The categories must mean something to choose , not that the defines .
You often see this problem with these huge search search problem .
Who 's supposed to say who they 're going to happen ?
My fourth category : <unk> complexity .
It turns out that we can run a lot more information than what we think , if you just have a little bit more .
We have to increase complexity gradually .
I 'm going to show you one example of what I mean .
Let 's look at a complicated decision ; it 's buying a car .
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows <unk> .
You have to take 60 decisions , to build the car .
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one .
<unk> , outside of the car . I have 56 possibilities .
It 's a box of changes ; four choices .
What I 'm going to do is to do is the order to make the decisions .
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of options , 56 colors , at a few , four boxes .
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices , four boxes , <unk> colors , many choices .
And what do I look at ?
What are you .
If you 're going to be always the button for a flaw in every decision , this indicates that they 're overwhelmed , or whether we 're missing .
We found that those who are going to have a lot of choices in a few other choices , they put the button for something and again , and another more .
We lose .
If you 're going to get a few choices to many , they continue there .
The same information , the same number of choices .
The only thing I did was to alter the order to the information that shows the information .
If we started with how easy , you learn to pick up .
So , when you pick the box of change , I do n't tell anything about the preferences of the interior interior , in all ways we 're going to be able to choose .
We 're very excited about a product that we 're building in the process of the process .
To summarize it .
I 've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the brain 's problem : <unk> , <unk> strange alternatives -- <unk> , do real , we can run more categories with less choices -- <unk> complexity .
All of these techniques that I 've shown you were designed to help the alternatives -- or better , for you , to use them in their issues , or for people who serve them .
It 's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to pick them .
And the more careful to be in our best choices , we can practice the art of choice .
Thank you very much .
In the '80s , in the East Germany , if you had a machine writing to write to the government .
I had to record a little bit written with the machine .
And so the government could track the origin of the texts .
If they were a written wrong message , you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea .
In the West , we do n't think that somebody could do this , so much that this <unk> the freedom of expression .
Never do that in our countries .
But today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and a page , that page , a little bit of yellow dots in each page that you 're going to do a pattern that makes them own one and a printer .
That 's happening today .
And no one seems to <unk> a lot of this .
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us , citizens .
And it 's one of the three fundamental causes of problems on the network .
If we look at what happens in the world online , we can put them on the attacks of the attacks .
There are three major groups .
They 're the cybercriminals .
Like Mr. Jacobs <unk> from the city of Kiev , in Ukraine .
It 's very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use them to make a lot of money , a lot of lots of lots .
There 's really a lot of cases in the line , <unk> , that <unk> money with their attacks .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> , Estonia .
This is Alfred Bezos .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is <unk> <unk> .
These are Anderson Anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on .
These guys do their <unk> , but they do it because they do it because they do it by illegal bank to steal money from our bank when we buy it online , or you take our key to get information from our cards when we bought in a living computer .
The secret of the United States , two months ago , he said the Swiss account of this gentleman , Sam <unk> , and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
Mr. Twain is going to be able to do it .
And I say today is more likely than anyone of us is a victim for a real crime .
And it 's very obvious that this is going to be wrong .
In the future , most of the crimes we 're going on online .
And the second group of protest that we observe today is not inspired by money .
There 's another thing that moves them , they care about the protests , they motivate the opinions , they inspire the laughs .
<unk> like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months , there was a whole role in the attacks .
And those are the three topics , the criminals that they do for money , <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the national America who attack .
And then we see cases like <unk> .
That 's a good example of government attack against their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> authority authority , or actually , it was .
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk> .
You know the safety of the site and a <unk> .
The past week I asked , in a meeting of Dutch government , I asked one of the leaders if they had to have given the death of people in the attack of the attack to <unk> .
And the answer of him was yes .
So , how does people die of a attack of these ?
<unk> is a <unk> authority .
It 's going to take it up .
Why is the GMT ?
Well , you need if you have a website with <unk> , <unk> <unk> , services as Tolstoy .
Except , we would be a foreign authority authority .
And that 's all about <unk> <unk> .
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly that .
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened , for example , in Egypt ?
Well , in Egypt , the mayor of the Egyptian secret police police , 2011 , and during the city of the building , they found a lot of papers .
Among those papers was this folder called `` <unk> . ''
And within that folder , there was a company of a company in Germany that had been sold the Egyptian government to intercept a great scale of the citizens of the country .
They had been sold this tool for 12,000 euros to the Egyptian government .
The company of the company is right here .
Or , Western governments can provide tools to work to the citizens of their citizens .
But Western governments also do this .
For example , in Germany , just just a couple of weeks ago , I found the <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> used by the German government of the German government to investigate their own citizens .
If you 're a little bit like a little criminal case , it 's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk> .
But today 's going beyond .
The connection to the Internet connection .
We 're going to be even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow us to see all the communication , and listening to the conversation online , to get our data .
When we think about things like these , the obvious answer should be , `` Well , it seems something bad , but I actually do n't affect me because I 'm a honest citizen .
Why do you worry ?
I do n't have anything to hide . ''
And that argument no sense .
It 's about privacy .
privacy is not arguing .
It 's not a question of privacy against security .
It 's about freedom against control .
If we could trust our governments today , in 2011 , any right that we 're going to do today , be forever .
<unk> in any future government , in a administration that we could have within 50 years ?
These are the questions that we have to worry about the next 50 years .
Here 's where I live . I live in Kenya , in the south part of Nairobi in Nairobi .
These are the cows of my dad , the bottom , and behind the cows , the National Park in Nairobi .
The National Park does n't have the most extreme part of the south , what it means that wild animals like <unk> <unk> out of the park .
And predators , like lions , they follow them , and this is what they do .
It 's <unk> our livestock .
This is one of those who killed by night , and as soon as we got dead , I felt very bad because it was the only one you know that we had .
My community , the <unk> , we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> , and therefore we value them so much .
So I grew up with a lot of the lions .
They 're dying that protect our community and livestock , and they 're also upset with the problem .
So they kill lions .
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi .
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi .
A child in my community , from six to nine years , is responsible for her father , and this was the same thing that happened to me .
So I had to find a way to fix this problem .
My first idea was to use fire , because I thought that the lions were scared .
But I realized that actually this did n't afford to do , because even they 're not given the lions to see the foreground .
I did n't give me . He went on .
A second idea was to use a <unk> .
It was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was close to the narrator .
But lions are very intelligent , the first day , and you saw the <unk> , and they were , but the second day , they came and said , `` This thing does n't move , it 's always here . So I got and killed and killed animals .
So one night I was walking around a torch and that day lions did n't come .
I found that lions are afraid to the light that moves .
So I had an idea .
And I got a switch with the way to turn up and turn out the lights .
And this is a little lamp of a flashlight .
<unk> everything .
As you can see , the solar panel , the battery load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the little box of <unk> . I call it a transformative .
And the box of <unk> makes the <unk> lights .
As you can see , the <unk> can go out , because it 's where lions come from .
And this is how they see the lions when they come from night .
The <unk> lights , and they 're sending the lions to think that I 'm walking through the foreground , but I 'm sleeping in my bed .
Thank you .
So I put them in my house two years ago , and since then , we would never have trouble with lions .
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea .
One of them is about this grandmother .
She had killed many animals , lions and asked if I could put the lights .
I said yes .
So , you can see the bottom , these are the lights for lions .
Since then , I 've been stored in seven houses in my community and they 're serving a lot .
And my idea is also used by all Kenya , to express other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it 's also using the elephants of the farms .
Thank you , this invention , I had a fortune to get a grant in one of the best schools of Kenya , <unk> International International International Center , and I 'm very excited .
My new school is helping raise funds and <unk> .
I even took my friends to my community and building lights in the houses that they do n't have , and I teach you how to put them .
So , a year ago , it was just a child in the savanna of the savanna , the cows of my father , and I used to see aircraft fly , and I used to be able to fly back , and I was saying that one day would be inside one .
And today I 'm here .
I had a chance to come in plane for the first time to TED .
My great dream is to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when it grows .
I used to hate lions , but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and lions , we can be with lions without any conflict .
<unk> <unk> . What in my language means , thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I do n't think of the exciting thing that is listening to a story like yours .
So you get a scholarship . Richard <unk> : Yeah .
CA : You 're working on other electrical inventions .
What 's the next one on your list ?
<unk> : My next invention is -- I want to do a little bit of power . CA : A close to power ?
<unk> : I know that they 're already invented the electric pressure , but I want to do mine .
CA : You know , I 'm going to do it once , right ? And you know , <unk> : I 've tried it before , but I couple because I got a <unk> . CA : On the front of the cannon . Richard <unk> , you 're something big .
We 're going to be <unk> in every step , and I friend me .
Thank you very much .
When it was small , I thought my country was the best on the planet .
And I grew up singing a song called `` No <unk> . ''
And I was very proud .
In school , we passed all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> , but we never learned about the rest of the world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I wondered about the rest of the world , I thought that my entire life in North Korea , until it all changed a sudden .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution .
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was n't poor and I had never been hungry .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from my sister .
He said , `` When I put this , the five members of the <unk> family in this world , because we have n't eaten in two weeks old .
We 're <unk> together on the floor , and our bodies are so weak , that we 're prepared to die . ''
It was very <unk> .
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country .
At a little time , when I walked in front of the train station , I saw something terrible I ca n't erase my memory .
A woman without life was dead in the street , holding a child <unk> in their arms , looking at his arms , you know , her mother 's face without able to do anything .
Nobody gave them , because they were very worried about taking themselves and their families .
It 's a huge famine on North Korea in the '90s .
In the end , more than a million died died in the famine , and only few survived survived grass , insects and cortex .
It 's also made more and more likely , the <unk> of energy , everything was entirely dark at night except by the lights of the sea in China , just crossing the river from my house .
I always asked why they had light and we did n't .
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighbors .
This is the <unk> River , which is the edge between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very thin in certain dots , allowing to the Olympic Institute .
But many die .
Sometimes , I looked at bodies floating on the river .
I ca n't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea , but I can just say that for the years of famine , I was sent to China to live with relatives relatives .
But I just thought it would be separated from my family for short time .
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back to live together .
In China , it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family family .
I had no idea of how life would be like <unk> .
But soon , I learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but also dangerous , because the U.S. refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants .
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> , and it would be <unk> a horrible destination back in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare was actually done , when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> me in the police station .
Someone had told me to be <unk> , then I put my skills in Chinese language and made a lot of questions .
He was <unk> .
I thought my heart was going to exploit .
If it was n't natural , it could be incarcerated and <unk> .
I thought my life was going to end .
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions .
In the end of the United States , a officer said , `` This was a fake report . She 's not <unk> . ''
And let me go . It was a miracle .
Some of them in China are looking at home in the foreign cell .
But many can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> .
These women were very lucky .
Although they had captured , they were eventually released after a international pressure .
These countries were n't so lucky .
Every year , there are <unk> , they 're captured in China and <unk> North Korea , where they 're tortured , <unk> or executed .
Even though I was lucky to escape , many other countries have n't been so lucky .
It 's tragic than the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive .
Even after learning a new language and find work , everything can be <unk> in a moment .
It 's why , after 10 years to hide my identity , I decided to try to go to Korea .
And I started a new life again .
<unk> in Korea was a lot of more than I expected .
The English was very important in South Korea , I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I realized that there was a great gap between North and South .
We 're all right , but within , we 've come to be very different because of 67 years of division .
I even started an identity crisis crisis .
I 'm <unk> or <unk> ?
Where is I ? Who am I ?
In soon , there was no country that I could call with pride of mine .
Although you 're going to be <unk> life in North Korea was n't easy , I started studying for the income exam to University .
Just when I went to <unk> my new life , I got a alarming call .
The United States of North Korea , <unk> something of money that sent to my family , and , as punishment , my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location outside .
They had to run out immediately .
So I started planning how to help them escape .
America have to travel long distances on the way to freedom .
It 's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and North Korea .
So , ironically , I took a flight to China and went back to the border of North Korea .
So my family could n't speak Chinese , I had to give you , in a way , for more than three thousand kilometers through China and then through Asia .
The journey in <unk> took a week , and we 're almost trapped several times .
Once , our bus was stopped and met by a official officer .
He 's going to give you from all , and started asking questions .
As my family could n't understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
When the Chinese official came up to my family , I 've been able to put me up and I said that they were <unk> people who was accompanying .
I looked at me , but luckily I thought .
We did all the way to the border border .
But I had to spend almost all of my money to pay the guards to the guards .
But even after going on the border , my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border border .
Then , they can afford to pay up and bribes , my family was released in a month .
But at time , my family was arrested and incarcerated again on the capital of atrazine .
This was one of the most low dots in my life .
I did everything to liberate my family , and we were so close to , but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance of the North Korea .
I was going to come up and came into the office of immigration and the police station , desperately trying to liberate my family .
But I did n't have enough money to pay more bribes or incoherent .
I lost hope .
At that moment , or the voice of a man , `` What is the problem ? ''
I was so surprised that a unknown thing to ask .
With my poor English , and with a dictionary , I told him the situation , and no longer , the man was the ATM , and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two vessels and take them from prison .
And I read it all my heart , and I asked , `` Why do I help me ? ''
`` I 'm not helping you . ''
`` I 'm helping the <unk> people . ''
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life .
The kind of unknown , <unk> a new hope for me and for the village , when we needed it .
And I showed me that the kindness of the unknown community and the support of the international community are really the <unk> of hope that the people 's <unk> .
With the time , after our long journey , my family and I went together in Korea .
But they get your freedom is only half of the battle .
Many countries are separated from their families , and when we put a new country , they start with a little bit of money .
So , we can benefit from the international community with education , practices of English language , practical practices , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world .
Because a lot of us are still in contact contact with family , and we 're going to make information and money that 's helping change North Korea from inside .
I 've been very lucky , I 've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help up an opportunity to thrive with international support .
I 'm sure that you 're going to see more and more vessels in the world , including the TED stage .
Thank you .
I live in South Center .
This is South Center : shops of <unk> , fast food , <unk> .
So the city planners came together and thought , we 're going to change the name of South Center to represent something more , so they changed the United States , as if this <unk> what 's actually wrong in the city .
This is the South angels . <unk> <unk> , fast food , <unk> .
In the same way , <unk> millions of other Americans , I live in a food desert , Los Angeles Center , home from the food places to take and eat in the car .
The thing is that the places of food , to bring more people to get more people than food in the car .
People are dying of suspended diseases in Los Angeles .
So for example , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than , say , <unk> , which is like 15 kilometers away .
I 'll stop to see that this happens .
And I ask me , how would you feel if they did n't have access to healthy food , and if every time they go back home , you see the immune effects that the current food system has in its neighborhood ?
So I see , of the wheels , and they sold as well as they used .
So I see in <unk> <unk> .
And I consider this to stop .
I think the problem is the solution .
The food is the problem , and it 's the solution .
In addition to me , I got to run 45 minutes to run 45 minutes and turn back to buy a apple that has no pesticides .
What I did , was planting a forest of food in front of my house .
In a team of land that we call a gardening .
It 's 45 me .
The point is , it belongs to the city .
But you have to keep it .
I said , `` Well , I can do what I 'm going to get to me , because it 's my responsibility and I have to hold it . ''
So it was like I decided to do it .
So my group and me , <unk> Green , we put them together , and we started planting our food forest , trees <unk> , you know , nine full vegetables .
So what we do , we 're a kind of paid a paid group of a paid , and we made a paid of all the benefits , all the city and completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
And the garden was beautiful .
Then somebody complained .
The city looked at me , and in short , they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden , the <unk> had been able to get my garden .
And I said , `` Come on , right ?
A <unk> order to plant food in a piece of land that nobody matters ? '' So I was like , `` Well , <unk> . ''
Because this time was n't going to happen .
L.A. , Times had been written by Steve <unk> , and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members of <unk> , who put a petition in <unk> , with 900 signatures , a success .
We had the victory in our hands .
My <unk> , I even call it to say that they 're going to be able to say , <unk> and loved what we were doing .
I mean , why do n't you ?
Nine is the city of the United States with more <unk> terrain .
It 's about 68 kilometers of <unk> .
That 's about 20 Central Central .
That 's enough enough to planting <unk> million tomato plants .
Why do you do n't seem good this ?
It 's going to give a <unk> plant , 10 thousand seeds .
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars a result .
It 's my dogmas , when I 'm telling people , you get your own food .
You know , <unk> your own food is as print your own money .
You see , I have a legacy for South Center .
I grew up there . Let 's get my children there .
I 'm going to be part of this reality , which was <unk> for me for me for me , and I 'm going to make my own reality .
You see , I 'm an artist .
The gardening is my <unk> , my art .
So , as an artist 's artist , which would <unk> walls , I would <unk> land , <unk> .
I use the garden , the land , as a piece of canvas , and the plants and the trees , are my <unk> of that canvas .
You 'd be surprised to see what the land can do . If you let them be his canvas .
You can just imagine the amazing thing that it 's a <unk> , and how they affect people .
What happened ?
I 'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education , to transformation from my neighborhood .
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the land .
We 're the land .
You 'd be surprised to see how they affect the guys .
The gardening is the most skilled act and thought they can do , especially in a <unk> .
Also , you get a quick .
I remember one occasion , who came to a mother and his daughter , were like the periphery of night , and they were in my garden , I went down and looked very <unk> .
So , good , man , I sat wrong , and I said , you do n't have to do this .
This is the street for a reason .
I felt shame to look at people who was so close to me with hungry , and this is just why I do this , people ask me , `` Great , do n't benefit that people are going to steal your food ? ''
I mean , `` For God , I do n't have to fear that you 're going to steal . ''
So , it 's on the street .
That 's what it is .
I want you to take you up , but again , I want to get your health . ''
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a prison shelter in the center of Los Angeles .
They were these guys , that helped me download the truck .
It was fabulous , brought me their stories about how this had been affected , and how they used to plant her mom and his grandmother , and it was fabulous to see how this changed , so just for a moment .
So , <unk> <unk> has come to land maybe 20 gardens .
We 've had , like about 50 people who come up , they work and participate , all in voluntary plan .
If the kids grow <unk> , the guys will eat <unk> .
If they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes , but if anything of this is taught , if you 're not taught how the food affects the mind , and the body , they eat what you put in front .
I see young people who want to work , but they have this thing where they 're stuck . I see the color of color that are in this way that is designed for them , which does n't take it anywhere .
With the gardening , I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who knows ?
Maybe you produce the next George Washington Washington .
But if we do n't change the composition of the land , we never do it .
Now this is one of my plans , this is something I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens , where people can share food on the same block .
I want to take you back and turn it into healthy overweight .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about free things , because it 's not sustainable .
The funny thing about sustainability , is that you have to <unk> .
So what I 'm talking to is to put people to work to people , take the kids on the street , that know the joy , the pride and the honor of grow their own food , opening markets from farmers .
What I want to do here , we have to do it sexy .
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
We need to change the script of what 's a <unk> .
If you 're not a therapist , you 're not a <unk> .
What would you take them to take their own agree ?
That 's his gun gun .
In sum , if you want to meet with me , well , if you want to see me , I do n't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk to make some shit -- to talk to make some shit .
If you want to see me , they come to the garden with his script so that we could plant something .
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
( <unk> .
It 's made of asphalt , and asphalt is a good material to drive , but not always , particularly not in days as today , in which it rains .
You can have a great amount of water in the pavement that 's going to happen .
And especially if you 're going to go into your bike and these cars go , that 's not very nice .
Also , asphalt can make a lot of noise .
It 's a noisy material , and if we build roads , as in the Netherlands , very close to cities , you would want a silent road .
So the solution for that is to do <unk> .
Cows , a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands , has pores and water can go through it , because the water water will flow around the sides and you 're a road that 's easy to drive , and not <unk> water .
The noise also disappear in these pores .
Because it 's very hollow , all the noise disappear , so it 's a very quiet road .
It 's also a disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that you can get rid of .
What is you to get ? You see that in this road the rocks of the surface is coming out .
First of a rock , then several more and more and more and more and more and more , and then -- well , I 'm not going to do that . But you can not be confused her back , and you 're not happy with that .
And finally , this can also take more and more damage .
Sometimes you can create it .
Ah . It 's ready .
<unk> , of course , you can turn on a problem , but we have a solution .
Here you can see really how the damage looks like in this material .
It 's a benign pavement , as I said , so it 's just a little amount of <unk> between the stones .
Because of the ones , to the light light , to install it , this <unk> , the glue between <unk> , <unk> , and if you 're <unk> , they 're going to be <unk> and spread from the <unk> .
So , if you drive the road , you 're going to take the <unk> -- as we saw it here .
To solve this problem , we think about <unk> materials .
If we can do this material , then we probably have a solution .
So what we can do is use steel steel , that to clean <unk> , and we can cut steel steel in very small pieces , and we can mix these little little bits with the <unk> .
So we have asphalt with small pieces of steel in him .
Then you need a machine , as you can see here , you use to cook -- a <unk> machine .
<unk> can heat , especially steel , is very good at that .
So what you have to do is it 's going to do is the steel , melt the <unk> , the <unk> flow for these <unk> and the stones to go back back to the surface .
Today I used a microwave oven , because I ca n't bring the great machine machine here .
The microwave oven is a similar system .
I put the sample , which I 'm going to take you to see what happened .
This is the sample that comes out right now .
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples .
We started many samples there and then the government , you actually saw our results , and they thought , `` Well , that 's very interesting . We need to try . ''
So we made a piece of road , 400 feet of the <unk> highway , where we had to do a lane lane to test this material .
So that 's what we did there . You see where we were doing the test on the road , and then , of course , this road last several years without any harm . That 's what we know about practice .
We took a lot of samples of this road and test them in the lab .
We made the samples , we put a lot of load in them , and they put them together with our <unk> machine , and they put them back and we went back .
We can repeat this many times .
Well , to conclude , I can say that we 've done a material using steel fibers , feeds these fibers , using the energy energy energy , actually , increase the life of the surface of the road , even you can double the life of the surface of the road , even you can save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
And now , of course , you have curiosity if this also worked .
We still have the sample here . It 's pretty hot .
Actually , you have to cool first before I can show you how to show the repair .
But I 'm going to do an attempt .
Let 's see . Yeah , it worked .
Thank you .
When I was 11 years old , I remember , I remember , I 've got a morning with the sound of the <unk> .
My father was listening in his little gray radio .
I had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those times , because the news is usually <unk> .
`` The Taliban were , `` The Taliban were . ''
I did n't know what it meant , but I could see my father was very , very happy .
`` Now yes , you can go to a real school . ''
One morning I never forget .
A real school .
You 'll see , I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and made it illegal that girls were to school .
For the next five years , I 'm going to tell me as a child to <unk> my older sister , who could n't be used outside , to go to a secret school .
It was the only way that the two could survive .
Every day , it 's a different route for no one that no one could be willing to where we were .
We had to hide the books in the market , so that we had to be buying .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us had a small room .
It was nice in the winter , but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew that we 're going to make our lives , the teacher , students and our parents .
Instead , the school was known for a week , because the Taliban Taliban .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
We were going to go back ?
Did you know where we live ?
We were <unk> , but yet , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time .
A total range of a remote province of Afghanistan , and I would have her daughter , my mother , went to school and so his father would be <unk> .
But my married mother became a teacher .
This is her .
It took two years ago , just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood .
And my father , this is the first one of his family to receive education .
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education , even their daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
For him , there was a higher risk in not educate their children .
For the years of the Taliban , I remember that I was very frustrated for our life , and I was always scared and I did n't see a future .
I wanted to give me , but my father said , `` <unk> , daughter daughter , you can lose everything you have in life .
You can steal your money . You can leave your house for a war .
But there 's one thing that will always be with you , what 's here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education , we 'll do it .
So , you still want to do not continue ? ''
I have 22 years .
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades .
Less than six percent of the women 's women have more than high school , and if my family had n't been so engaged with my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I find me up here , so I 've been so proud to graduate College .
When I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , which was <unk> out of his home for the courage of educate their daughters , was one of the first one .
He did n't just get my college title of my college title , but I 'm also the first woman , and I 'm the first woman , I 've got it driving by the streets of Kabul .
My family believe in me .
I dream in big , but my family has even bigger dreams for me .
That 's why I 'm the global topography of <unk> , a global campaign to educate women .
It 's why I 'm called <unk> , the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan , a country in which it 's still risky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity .
And I see their parents and their families that , like mine , <unk> for them , despite the front of a certain opposition .
As Ahmed . It 's not the real name , and I ca n't show you your face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter went out of <unk> to his village , and , literally , they 're willing to be killed by a pump on the way , for minutes .
When I came to his house , they 're the phone , a voice told him that if I kept sending his daughter to school , it 's going to try .
`` <unk> , if you want , '' he said , `` We do n't hurt the future of my daughter for your old daughter and <unk> ideas . ''
What I 've been given to Afghanistan , and it 's something that 's often forgotten in the West , is that behind the majority of those who we had , there 's a father who recognized the value of his daughter , and it looks like the success of her own success .
It does n't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success .
In fact , often , they 're often the first <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters , but in the context of a society like Afghanistan , we need the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls who were in the school , the girls who were in the school , they 're illegal .
But today , more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is so different from here in America .
I find the Americans see the fragility of the changes .
I 'm afraid that these changes would n't spend a lot , after the retirement of the U.S. troops .
But when I look back to Afghanistan , when I look at the students in my school and their parents who would be <unk> for them , I see a <unk> future and a durable change .
For me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities , and every day , the girls of <unk> told me .
Like me , they dream in big .
Thank you .
Never , I 've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the exile , `` <unk> , resists Gaddafi . <unk> against him .
But you would never go back to you a brave style .
It has been almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> revolution as the Egyptian revolution .
A forces with a lot of other other citizens <unk> , within and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the poison regime .
And we did it , it was a great revolution .
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the top of the regime , they 're carrying by freedom , dignity and social justice .
You 've shown a <unk> courage to the face of Gaddafi .
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East , to the West , to the south .
And finally , after a period of an brutal war , and some loss of about 50 thousand dead , we managed to liberate our country and reacting to the tyrant .
However , Gaddafi left a heavy load , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds .
For four decades , the <unk> regime of Gaddafi destroyed the infrastructure , culture and the moral structure of the society .
Be aware of the devastation and of the challenges , I 've wanted to have a lot of other women , rebuild the civilian society , which is a inclusive transition , and just just to democracy .
It 's about 200 organizations in <unk> over , and immediately after the each of Gaddafi . About 300 in <unk> .
After a period of 33 years of exile , I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm , I started to organize workshops on the development of capabilities , and skills skills .
With an amazing group of women , we started the Global Women , a movement of women , leaders , very diverse orientation , to advocate for the <unk> of the woman , and by our problems of equal participation in the ground of democracy and peace .
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period , a environment that was more and more <unk> , which is the selfish policy of domination and exclusion .
With the time , our initiative was gone and successful .
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years .
However , a little bit of a little bit , the trailers of elections and the revolution like a whole , they were disappearing ; every day we had the news of violence .
So one day , we wake up with the news of the <unk> of the ancient mosques and graves .
Another day , <unk> with the news of the American ambassador , and the attack to <unk> .
Another day , we wake up with the news of the military of the army .
And every day , every day , we wake up with the government 's government , and they gave them out of human rights of the prisoners and their lack of respect of the law .
Our society , made by a revolutionary mindset , <unk> more , and it 's from the ideal and the principles of freedom , dignity , social justice , that we had at the beginning .
You know , <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution .
I 'm not here at all to inspire our history of the success of the <unk> , and the election .
So I 'm here today to tell you that we , as a nation , we choose bad , we took the wrong decision .
We do n't do well .
Because the election did n't get peace , stability and security to Libya .
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and sold it to have a national reconciliation ?
No , they did n't .
What happened ?
Why is our society and dominated with selfish policies of domination and exclusion , both for men like women ?
Perhaps it was missing not only women , but the women of compassion , mercy and alien .
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than we needed the election , which just <unk> the polarization and the division .
Our nation needs the analog representation of the women more than I need to have the high-tech representation and <unk> of it .
We need to be able to stop acting like the outrage of outrage , and I 'm going to call them out of anger .
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy .
We need to develop a female speech , which is not just <unk> , but also put it in practice , but also put it in practice , collaboration instead of the competition , the inclusion instead of the competition .
These are the ideal that an Libya , they 're treated by the war , it needs desperately to get peace .
Because peace has a little bit that it 's about <unk> and <unk> between the female perspectives and the male .
That 's the real <unk> .
We need to set out that in a existential way before we do it .
according to a <unk> of the Koran `` <unk> '' -- peace -- `` It 's the word of God 's word , <unk> , compassionate . ''
At the time , the word `` <unk> , '' which is known in all the <unk> traditions , it has the same root in Arabic that the word `` <unk> '' -- French -- <unk> , <unk> the entire humanity that men and women , which all tribes and all the tribes and all the people have <unk> .
And so , the same thing that the uterus covers the embryo , which is growing inside , the standard matrix of compassion , all the existence .
So , it tells us , `` My mercy knows all things . ''
So , it tells us , `` My favorite wisdom on my anger . ''
That 's all the grace of mercy .
Thank you .
I 'm here today to talk to you about a logical question , which has a equally controversial response .
It 's about the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I 'm going to address is what they 're going to address is that they all do , why did it go ?
Why would you be somebody going to stay with a man who was stored ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , no social worker , not an expert in domestic violence .
I 'm just a woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 years old . He had been <unk> at the University of Harvard .
I had moved to New York for my first work as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first <unk> green , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that a lot of times , a lot of times , the man , that I create my Olympic soul , I would put me on my head with a gun , <unk> with bullets .
The man , that I loved more than no one in this world , put a gun in my head , and they 're going to kill me more times that I can remember .
I 'm here to tell you the story of `` crazy love , '' a psychological pursuit , who fall every year million women , and even some men .
It could be his story .
I do n't a picture of the domestic violence .
I 'm <unk> in English at the University of Harvard , and I have a MBA in <unk> Business Business School .
I 've been most part of my career working for <unk> companies , between the Johnson Johnson , Leo <unk> and The Washington Post .
I 've been almost 20 years who married my second husband and have three children .
My dog is a black child , and I 'm trying to take a <unk> <unk> .
So my first message for you is that violence violence can happen to anyone , all the races , all of the religion , all the levels of rent and education .
It 's everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks the domestic violence happens to women , which is a problem of women .
Not exactly .
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men , and the domestic abuse just happens in intimate relations , interdependent and long duration , or , in the families , the last place where we 'd want to , or we hope to find violence ; reason why , abuse of domestic abuse .
I would have said that it would be the last person in the world that was going with a man who was going to kill , and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age .
I was 22 years old , and in the United States , the women in between 16 and 24 years of age are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence for other ages , and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year for couples , Oslo and husbands in the United States .
I also went a typical victim because I did n't know anything about domestic violence , their warning , or their patterns .
I met <unk> on a cold and <unk> night .
I was sitting on my side in the New York City and started <unk> with me .
He told me two things .
The first one was that he also had a little bit of <unk> of a university , and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street .
But what I looked at me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun , and it looked like a kid of the field .
I had a little bit of big <unk> as apples , and it seemed so sweet .
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> , from the beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner .
He did it about the first principle of <unk> in a pedestal .
We start out , and I loved everything of me : I had gone to Harvard , who had been a passion to help girls , and my job .
I wanted to know everything about my family , my childhood , my dreams and illusions .
<unk> believed in me , as a woman , as a woman , like no one had done .
And it was why the age of the age of school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him .
I did n't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship , and they 're going to get it to the victim .
And I did n't know that the second step is <unk> .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and let the work of my dreams , but I thought I had to make you like to do it for your partner , so he accepted , I left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan .
I had no idea that I was falling in a `` crazy love , '' which was entering a head of head , financial and psychological psychological psychological psychological .
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it understands her .
And here is where these guns go on .
In the way , we move to New England , you know , that site where you 're supposed to be so safe I bought three guns .
One was in the <unk> of the car .
So another , the pillow under the pillow in our bed and the third always in your pocket .
And he said , I needed these guns to cause the trauma that lived from small .
I needed to feel safe .
But those guns were actually a message for me and , although I had never been raised my hand , my life was already seriously , every minute of every day .
The first physical attack of <unk> came up with five days before our wedding .
It was the seven of the morning , and I still had the <unk> .
Five days later , when the 10 floors of my neck had disappeared , I put my mother with my mother and married with him .
In spite of what had happened , I was sure we live happy forever , because I loved him , and he also wanted me a lot .
And I was very , very .
It just had been very overwhelmed by the wedding and for the fact to form a family with me .
It had been a isolated accident , and I would never make it hurt .
I spent two times more in our moon of honey .
The first time I was driving to a secret beach , and I lost me , and he gave me so strong on the head that we 've got several times against the car car .
And then , a couple of days later , driving back from our Moon Moon , <unk> for the traffic and threw me a Big Mac on the face .
<unk> went to <unk> one or two times a week for the next two years and a half of our marriage .
I 'm going to tell me when I thought it was the only one in this situation .
One of every three American women is a victim of domestic violence , or ADHD at some moment of his life , and the Social Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> , 15 million .
So , actually , I was very good company .
So , why did I get back to my question , why did I get me ?
The answer is simple .
I did n't know that he was wearing me .
Instead , I was a very strong woman , in love with a deeply <unk> man , and it was the only person in the world that could help be able to deal with their Earth .
The other question that everyone does is , why is it just not going to go ?
Why did n't I go ? I could have gone at any time .
To me , this is the most sad question , which makes people , because we know , the victims , we know something that you do n't know , it 's incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk> .
Because the last phase of violence violence is to kill them .
More than 70 percent of the murders of domestic violence occur after the victim is given to the relationship , after they go , because then the <unk> has no anything to lose .
Other implications include the permanent crime , even after the <unk> has become married , <unk> of financial resources , and manipulation of the financial system of family system to <unk> the victim and their children , who are usually forced for the judges to spend time not <unk> .
And we still still ask why it 's just not going to go ?
I was able to go out , because of a last <unk> , and they hit my denial .
I realized that the man who loved me so much , I would have killed if it was allowed .
So I broke the silence .
He told all the world : to the police , to my neighbors , to my friends and family , and I 'm here today because everyone else helped me .
We have the trend to <unk> the victims , like <unk> headlines , <unk> , goods .
The question , `` Why is there ? ''
For some people , it 's a way to say , `` The guilt is you to stay , as if the victims <unk> <unk> of men who want to destroy .
But since I published , <unk> love , '' I 've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also taught , who learned a preconceived lesson of what happened and that <unk> their lives and happy and mothers and mothers , lives completely free to violence , like mine .
Because it turns out that I 'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence .
I went back to me with a beautiful man and a nice man and have those three children .
I have this black hole , and also that <unk> .
What I did n't go back to have never more , ever , it 's a <unk> gun pointing on my head on somebody who says to me .
At this moment , they 're thinking , `` <unk> , that 's fascinating ! '' or `` <unk> , what stupid was , `` <unk> , '' but all this time I 've been talking about you .
I can tell you that there 's a few people , that I 'm listening to me right now , they 're being stored or that they 're a little bit of small or which are <unk> themselves .
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter , his sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to put my crazy love love to the silence .
And I keep doing today .
It 's my way to help other victims , and it 's my last petition to you .
Talk about what you heard here .
<unk> would be just in the silence .
They have the power to end up with domestic violence , just buying light on it .
The victims we need all over the world .
We need every one of you understand the secrets of domestic violence .
Take the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children , their friends , their friends and family .
It 's <unk> their vision of the survivors like fantastic and lovely people , who have a full future .
We 're going to get the signs of violence in violence to intervene consciously , to slow down their cut and show the victims a safe way .
So , we can turn our beds , our tables and our families in the safe oasis and rational that they should be .
Thank you .
Hi . I call Cameron Russell , and for a time , I 'm a model .
To be accurate , since 10 years ago .
And I feel that at this moment there is a awkward tension in the room , because I should n't have a dress , so , luckily , I 've brought some clothes for the way .
This is the first change in a TED stage , so you have a lot of <unk> , I think .
If some of the women were being treated when he came up , they do n't have to <unk> now , but I 'll find it later on Twitter .
I also want to point that I have the privilege to change what 's thinking about me as only 10 seconds .
Not all the world has this opportunity .
They 're very uncomfortable , less bad than I do n't have to use it .
The worst part is going to happen this sweater on the head , because it 's when they 're going to laugh for me , so I do n't do anything as I covers your head .
All right .
Why did I do this ?
It 's been embarrassing .
Well , I hope that not as a picture .
The appearance is powerful , but it also exists .
I 've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had never had a boyfriend in real life .
It was completely awkward and the photographer told me that I would get my back and put it out of the kid , and he would get her hair .
Of course , except with surgery or an artificial <unk> , like that I did two days ago for the work , there are very little that we could do to transform our way to transform our way , which , even though it 's a huge impact in our lives .
So today , for me , to be brave means to be honest .
I 'm on this stage because I 'm a model .
Because I 'm a nice woman and white , and in my labor sector , that 's being a sexy girl .
I 'm going to answer the questions that people always do me , but it 's a real way .
The first question is , how is it going to be a model ?
And I always say , `` A <unk> was discovered , but that does n't mean anything .
The real reason why I did a model is because won the genetic lottery , and I 'm a <unk> of an inheritance , and maybe you 're asking what this inheritance is .
Well , in the last few centuries , we 're not just defined beauty , youth and symmetry , which we 're biologically programmed to investigate , we 're also associated with a high and <unk> shape , and a white skin .
And that 's my inheritance , what I 've known to take up to make money .
And I know that there are people in the audience , which is now showing you , and maybe there 's a few <unk> of the fashion to say -- Wait , right . There are earthquakes , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
First of all , the <unk> to know so much of models . It 's amazing .
But I have to tell you that in 2007 , a Ph.D. student in the University of New York told all and every one of the models on the runway , and the <unk> models , just 27 , is , less than four percent , were n't white .
The next question that people are always doing me is : Would it be a model when it 's bigger ?
And my first answer is : I do n't know , I do n't know that .
But then , what I really would tell each one of these girls is , why ? You can be what you want .
You can be president of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a <unk> <unk> and poet , which would be impressive , because they 're the first .
If after this spectacular list , still prevents , no , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , then I say , `` Oh my boss .
Because I 'm not in charge of anything , and you could be the name of a book of the American journal , or the CEO of H & M , or the next Steven <unk> .
To say that you want to be a model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you 're higher .
It 's out of your control , it 's amazing , and it 's not a job you can choose .
I 'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model , because , unlike <unk> surgery , can be clear right now .
I do n't know what happened there .
Unfortunately , once you 've got to take up your studies , and you have a signature and a few jobs and a few jobs , no matter what they say , is , if you said , if you said , if you said , if you said , if you 're saying , you know , I want to be president of the United States , but your
The next question that people are always doing me is if all of the photos are <unk> .
And yes , you 're pretty much <unk> all the photos , but that 's just a little bit of what happens .
This was the first picture that took me , and it was also the first time he was used a trickiness , and I did n't even have my period .
I know we 're entering the personal field , but it was a child .
So I went along with my grandmother a few months before .
These two photos are the same day .
My friend came with me .
Here I 'm in a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk> .
Here I 'm with my soccer team , and in the journal Magazine .
And this is me now .
And I hope you realize that I 'm not in those photos .
It 's all of a group of professionals , <unk> , photographers and <unk> , and all of their <unk> and <unk> , and they get to create this . That 's not me .
Well , the next question , the next question that people are always doing me is , <unk> ?
I have too too much .
I grew up in Cambridge , and once I went to a store and I forgot to bring money , and they gave me the free dress .
When it was a teenager , I ended up with my friend , who was a little bit of <unk> , and , of course , we got a red light , and , of course , we got up , and it was a feeling , a agent for power .
I 'm going to get out of these privilege for me , not for what I 'm , and there are people who are paying a price for its way without matter who they 're .
I 'm going to live in New York , and last year , of the teenagers , teenagers who have been in and emerged , 86 percent of them were young men .
And there 's just <unk> young black young black people in New York , so for them , is n't a question of me ?
It 's about how many times I 'm going to do ? And when ?
When I research for this talk , I found out that at 53 percent of the girls at 13 years in the United States do n't like your body , and that number is going to take to 60 percent to 17 .
So , the last question that people ask me is : How is the life of a model ?
And I think the answer that they hope is : If you 're a little bit more and you have the most brilliant hair , you 're very happy , you 're very happy and fantastic .
And behind the cameras , we give a response that maybe it looks like this .
We say , it 's really wonderful to travel , and also amazing power to work with creative and creative people .
And all that 's true , but it 's just one part of what 's going on , because what we never do in front of the cameras , what I 've never told in front of the cameras , which I 've never told front of them .
And I 'm because I have to worry about my way every day .
And if you ever ask him , you know , a little more thin legs and the most brilliant hair , will be more happy ?
They just have to come together with a group of models , because they have the richest legs , the most brilliant hair and the more more to the fashion , but they 're likely to be the <unk> women on the planet .
But especially it was difficult to look at a situation of Indian oppression and gender , when I 'm one of the biggest <unk> .
If there 's something to retain this talk , I hope you all feel more comfortable to the power of the image in the perception of the perception of success and failure .
Thank you .
And the photograph has been my passion since it was much more enough to put a camera , but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures , and I did n't go to me who he got .
There was no artistic directors , no <unk> , no opportunity to repeat the photos , not even a carefully carefully in the lighting .
In fact , most of you put them down to random .
My story begins when , <unk> in the city of New York to give a second , my wife got me holding this picture holding my daughter in his first birthday . That 's the corner of 57 and five .
He gave the way we went back to New York , just a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well , you can imagine what it comes now .
When the third birthday of my daughter , my wife told me , why do n't you get to <unk> New York in a <unk> journey and you 're going to get the ritual ?
Here 's when we started to ask the tourists that we 're going to tell us the picture .
It 's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown .
Never no one has gone and , fortunately , never no one has <unk> with the camera .
So we were n't aware of how much we can change this journey .
It became something sacred for us .
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> , and I had to explain to my daughter , what had happened that I had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand .
These photos are much more than some concrete moment or a specific journey .
It 's also a way to stop the time in a week of October , and to make you think about our time and our evolution over the years , and not only to the physical level , but it 's not just the brain .
Because , although we always take the same picture , our perspective changes , my daughter gets new milestones , and I can see your life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything .
That time in particular that we went together is something that we hope with illusion every year .
So recently , in one of the trips , we were walking around , when suddenly , she stopped in dry and signal a red band of the tent that was a little bit of a small visits in previous visits .
And I described what it was about the five years of foot in that same place .
So , you know , he reminded her heart <unk> , with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago .
And now what you look at New York , because it 's starting to study in New York .
And suddenly I realized that one of the most important things we create is the memories .
So , I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories .
I do n't know , but aside of these 15 photos , I do n't go back in many of the family photos .
I 'm always the one that you take the picture .
Now , I want to talk to you all to come up on the picture , and I did n't have to come back to somebody and ask him , and you take a picture ?
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
You 're going to find them in the most threatened band .
First of all , why are you so bad press ?
It 's also been associated with Disney laughs , <unk> , stupid characters , stupid .
More recently , if you 've been looking at the press , <unk> laughs , applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they 're working with the athletic Parliament , but I do n't accept it .
I do n't accept it . You know why ?
Because the members of Parliament are no clean environment the environment , <unk> not help the spread of diseases .
They 're going to be <unk> . They 're far away to go out , and , my favorite , <unk> have better presence . There are two types of <unk> on this planet .
There 's the Russians in the New World , which are primarily in the Americas , as the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the World bombsight , where we have 16 species .
So , why are the prophet are important ? First of the first place , they provide vital ecological services .
They 're our natural garbage .
They 're going to get the bodies to the bone .
They 're going to kill all bacteria . They 're going to kill the anthrax that was not by them , and they would have great loss of livestock and diseases in other animals .
Studies have shown that in areas where there is no superficial studies , the bodies take three to four times more time in <unk> , and this has huge modules in the spread of diseases .
<unk> also have huge historical importance .
They 've been associated with the old Egyptian culture .
It was the symbol of the logic and the bathroom and , along with the king cobra , <unk> the unit between the altitude and the Egypt .
In the Hindu mythology , <unk> was the god <unk> , and he risked his life to save the <unk> of the devil of 10 heads .
In the <unk> culture , you 're doing very important to the open sky , and in places like Tibet , there 's no place to support the dead , or wood to <unk> , so that that 's getting a system of natural elimination .
What is the problem with the prophet ?
We have eight species in Kenya , which six are in the extreme endangered of extinction .
The reason is that they 're being labeled , and the reason that they 're being able to happen is because there are conflict between humans and wildlife . The <unk> communities use this poison against the predators , and as a consequence , those are victims of this .
In the south of Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of Zimbabwe are in the critical list of extinction , which means that in less than 10 or 15 years , <unk> , and the reason is because they fall out of the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug .
This drug has been influenced by <unk> in India and have taken a posture .
Now , because there 's no <unk> , there 's been a spread on the number of dogs 's number in <unk> , and when you have the wild dogs , you have a huge car car car for rage . The number of rage has been enormously on India .
Kenya is going to have one of the greatest wind parks in Africa : <unk> <unk> are going to be on the top of the Kennedy lake .
I 'm not not against wind energy , but we have to work with governments , because the cheapest turbines do this to the birds . They cut them through half .
They 're <unk> .
In West Africa , there 's a horrible trade of <unk> <unk> to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market .
So what is doing ? Well , we 're doing these birds . We 're going to make these birds .
We 're trying to determine its basic ecology , and see where they go .
We can see that travel for different countries , so focus on a problem , it 's not going to serve anything .
We need to work with governments in the regional levels .
We 're working with the local communities .
We 're talking to them about appreciating them on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
How can you help ? It can become active , make noise . You can write a letter to their government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures . It 's their time to spread on the word . It 's the word .
When you go out of this room , they 're going to report on this room , but they talk to their families , with their children , with their children on the GreenLab .
They 're very elegant . Charles Darwin said that it changed , because he saw them fly without effort , without energy spending in the heavens .
Kenya , this world , being much more poor without these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
Each thing I 'm doing , and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been influenced by seven years of work during my youth in Africa .
From 1971 to 1977 , <unk> young , but I was not . I worked in Zambia , Kenya , East d'Ivoire , Algeria and Somalia .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every project we set up in Africa .
And I was doing .
I thought , at the 21 , that the Italian were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa .
Instead of that , everything we did is <unk> .
Our first project , that inspired my first book , `` <unk> of the <unk> , '' it was a project where we decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food .
So , we got with the Italian seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that goes down to the <unk> River , and we teach the local , and we have to grow Italian , Italian , and ...
Of course , people were not at all interested in doing that , because they 're going to be able to come to work , and sometimes they do n't get up . We were amazed that the local valley , in so fertile valley , not had agriculture .
However , instead of asking how it was possible to do anything , we just said , `` Thank you , God we 're here . '' `` Just time to save the people in Zambia . ''
And of course , everything in Africa is <unk> .
We had these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy , a tomato , a tomato , and in Zambia , this size .
And we could n't believe , we were saying to the <unk> , `` Look what easy is agriculture . ''
When the tomatoes were great , infrared and red , from night in the morning , about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything . And we said , `` God , <unk> ! ''
And the <unk> said , `` Yes , why we do n't have agriculture here . '' `` Why did n't they do it ? '' `` You never asked . ''
And I thought , only , we 're going to just ask them to make mistakes in Africa , but then I saw what the Americans did , what they did the French , and then to see what they were doing , I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia .
Because , as you see , at least we feed the <unk> .
You know , you 're going to see the waste -- you 're going to see the waste that we 're going to give them to <unk> people from Africa .
He wants to read a book , I read , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The book was published in 2009 .
We , Western donors , we 've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years .
I do n't tell you about the damage that that money has caused .
Just read your book .
It 's a part of a African woman , the damage we 've done .
The Western ones , we 're guessing , <unk> <unk> , and we 're trying to people just two ways : or the presence , or we 're <unk> .
The two words come from the ultimate Latin <unk> , which means `` father . ''
However , they mean two different things .
<unk> , I try to have any different culture as if they were my children . `` I want you a lot . ''
<unk> , I 'm trying to all of a different culture as if they were my motivations .
So the white women in Africa are called `` <unk> . ''
That book gave me a bit of the face on the face , `` The small is beautiful , '' written by <unk> , who said by <unk> economic development , if people do n't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> .
This would be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference put this conference on the ground and said , `` We can imagine a city that 's not <unk> ? ''
I decided to just answer the 27 years , and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> , where you never start doing anything , you have never got no one , but it turns into a sense of the local passion , the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person .
So , what do you do ? It 's <unk> .
It does n't come to a community with an idea , and they sit with the people of the usual .
We do n't work from the offices .
We set up in a coffee . We met a bar .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what do we do ? We become friends , and we found what the person wants to do .
The most important thing is the passion .
You can give you an idea to somebody .
If that person does n't want to do that , what is going to do you ?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then , we help them find knowledge , because nobody in the world can be successful alone .
The person with the idea can not have knowledge , but knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why do n't we , for once you get to a community to tell people what to do , why do n't , for once , for once , we hear ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There 's a problem with community meetings .
The entrepreneurial entrepreneurs never will say , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity have been identified .
So the planning has this blind point .
The most intelligent people in their community , you do n't even know it , because they do n't know , because they do n't have to cover your public meetings .
What do we do ? We work with one of you , and we work face face , you have to create a social infrastructure , which does n't exist .
You must create a new career .
The career is the family of the company of the company , the family of the business family , which is generated with you , in the table of his kitchen , in the coffee table , and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of buying life .
I started this as a test in <unk> , city Australia .
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time , trying to walk out of this kind of <unk> garbage that we 're going to tell you what to do .
In a year , I had 27 projects in running , and the government came to me to see , `` How can you do that ? ''
How can we do it ? '' And I said , `` I did something very , very , very difficult .
I fell and listened to me . So , the government says , `` <unk> again . '' We 've done it in 300 communities in the world .
We 've helped to start 40 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness .
Peter <unk> , one of the most awful medical graduates of history , passed up to 96 , a few years ago .
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business , and this is what Peter <unk> : `` planning , it 's actually incompatible with a society and an innovative economy . ''
The planning is the kiss of death of the spirit of the spirit .
So now , we 're going to be able to be able to be able to know what the most <unk> people in order to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn to get these people to get these people to talk to you with you .
You have to offer some of us , privacy , has to be fantastic to help them , and then <unk> , go on the mass .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400 people , intelligence and passion ?
What 's you show you more this morning ?
That 's what you 've got to do . That 's what you have <unk> .
So , what I 'm telling you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is .
We 're at the end of the first industrial revolution , <unk> fossils , manufacturing -- and from a moment to another , we have systems that are not sustainable .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
The <unk> as a way of support is not sustainable .
What we have to consider , is how <unk> , imagination , we do , we communicate , we communicate to seven billion people , in a sustainable way .
There 's no technology to do it .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution , the universities ? Forget !
The government ? Forget !
You 're going to be the entrepreneurs and they 're doing now .
There 's a very simple story that I read a lot , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year .
And in the year , it came together this group of people , and we 're going to get it out of what happened to New York City in 100 years , and the conclusion was <unk> : New York City would n't exist within 100 years .
Why ? Because they put the curve and say , if the population is growing to this rate , to move to the population of New York to the surroundings , <unk> six million horses , and the dung produced for six million horses , and the dung produced for six million horses would be impossible to address .
They were already <unk> in dung . So , in terms , they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City .
So , what happens ? In the next 40 years , in 1900 , in the United States , <unk> <unk> companies , <unk> .
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few , <unk> , factories in places .
Uh , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to offer them .
In the other way , they would n't come to talk to you with you .
Then , you have to offer a absolute , dedicated service service .
And then , later , you have to tell you the truth with it .
The smallest company , the bigger company , has to be able to do three big things : the product you want to sell you have to sell it to be fantastic , you have to count with a fantastic marketing , and you have to count with a fantastic administration administration .
You know what ?
We 've never met a single human being in the world that can do , selling and looking for money alone .
No .
This is still not born .
We 've observed and looked at 100 companies in the Carnegie and Carnegie , Edison , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There 's just one thing that all companies have in the world have in common , just one : None of it was started by one person .
Not the word `` I , '' but the word `` we , '' 32 times .
He was n't just when it started .
Nobody begins a single company . Nobody .
So , we can create the community where we have facilitators , who come from a small business environment in bars , in bars with their dedicated reporters who are going to do for you , what somebody did for this lady who talks about this room , somebody who 's going to ask you , what do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
Well , can you sell ? Can you look for money ? ''
`` Oh , no , I ca n't do that . '' `` Would n't I look at somebody ? ''
We activate communities .
Thank you .
That around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives .
We do n't know all the neighbors , so we do n't do a lot of knowledge to share the same public spaces .
In the past years , I 've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space , with simple tools like <unk> , 94 and chalk .
These projects came from questions like , how much pay my neighbors for their apartments ?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door at a bad moment ?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our landscape ?
How do we share more of our hopes to the cows shops so that our communities can measure our needs and dreams ?
I live in New York and I 'm in love from New York .
My soul , you 're always able to interact with the giant <unk> that they give you in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in a city .
It 's always going to move to the music , there 's a <unk> in New City . The city has one of the most beautiful system of the world , but also one of the most important properties of the United States .
I live close to this house , and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost somebody who loved a lot .
It was Joan , like a mother for me .
It was sudden and unexpected .
I thought a lot of death .
And this made me a profound gratitude for the life .
I gave it clarity to the significant things of my current life .
But <unk> for keeping this look in my everyday life .
It seems to me that it 's easy to get a day for day and forget the really important thing to one .
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this home home , and I painted it on her phrases to come out , `` Before you die , '' `` Before you die . ''
So they could take a chalk , thinking about their lives and sharing personal aspirations in the public space .
I did n't know what to wait about this experiment , but the next one day the wall was on , and I kept <unk> .
And I 'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall .
`` Before you die , I want to be written by piracy . '' `` Before you die , I want to sit on <unk> on the line of date . ''
`` Before you die , I want to hear for millions of people . ''
`` Before you die , I want to put a tree . ''
`` Before you die , I want to live out of the network . ''
`` Before you die , I want to get more more time . ''
`` Before you die , I want to go to the rescue of somebody . ''
`` Before you die , I want to be completely myself . ''
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people to get me laughing , <unk> me , and they gave me comfort in difficult times .
It 's about to know that you 're not just alone . It 's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> . It 's about giving the reflection to the reflection and free , and to remember what 's most important for us as we grow and change .
This happened last year , and I started having hundreds of messages of people who wanted to do a wall in his community .
So with my colleagues in the civic center , we made a kit , and now they have made walls in countries around the world , as Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
So we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express each other .
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relations with other people .
In our era of <unk> , it 's more important than never , to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remembering that life is a little bit and delicate .
The death is something that we often have to talk about , or even think , but I understand that to prepare for death is one of those things that would be more power .
Think of the death , we think of our life .
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope , fears and stories , the people around us can not help improve places , can help improve our lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I have a only petition .
Please tell me that I 'm normal .
Now I 'd like to introduce you to my siblings .
<unk> is 22 years old , and very beautiful .
It does n't talk , but it 's going to be a better joy that some of the best speakers speakers .
<unk> knows what the love is .
It 's how it happened to happen what happens .
It 's not <unk> . It does n't look at the color of the skin .
It does n't matter the religious differences and notice in this : never lied .
When I hate songs of our childhood , trying to tell the words that I do n't even remember , I remember one thing : the little thing we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the unknown .
Samuel is 16 years old . It 's high .
They have the most unexpected memory .
However , it 's a selective memory .
I do n't remember if I get my <unk> , but remember the year that came every one of the songs of my iPod , conversations that we did when I was four years old , you 're going to put into my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the birthday of Lady Lady .
Does n't be amazing ?
But most people do n't agree .
And , in fact , because their minds does n't adjust to the concept of normal society , often are ignored and <unk> .
But what brought my heart to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case , even though I do n't consider them inside the ordinary , that could just mean one thing : that was a <unk> -- <unk> and extraordinary .
Now , for those less familiar with the term `` autism , '' is a complex brain disorder that affects social media , learning and sometimes the physical skills .
In every individual , this is a different way , that we 're going to be so different to Sam Sam .
And around the world , every 20 minutes , it was diagnosed with a new case of autism , and even though it 's one of the development of the development that faster increases in the world , there 's no cause no known cure .
I do n't agree about my first encounter with autism , but I do n't remember one day without him .
I had only three years old when my brother came to the world , and I was very excited to have a new being in my life .
When a few months ago , I realized that he was different .
It 's a lot .
I did n't want to play the other babies and , in fact , it did n't seem very interested in me at me at all .
It was living in their own world , with their own rules , and I found pleasure in the smallest things , like putting the cars in a row around the room , looking at the washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing washing machine .
As I grew up , it would come back more different , and the differences are made more obvious .
But more beyond the <unk> , the frustration and the Hebrew hyperactivity , there was something really unique : an pure , innocent nature , a child who looked at the world without prejudice , a human being that never lied .
Ma .
I ca n't deny that there 's been some difficult moments in my family , moments that they would have to be just like me .
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality , communication and love , and I realize that they do n't want to change by the normal .
And the normal happens for high beauty that they give us the differences and the fact that it does n't mean that some is wrong .
It just means that there 's a different vision of what it is right .
If I could take one thing to <unk> and Sam and you , it would be that they do n't have to be normal .
They can be extraordinary .
Because , <unk> or not , the differences we have -- they 're a gift ! Every one of us has a gift in its inside and , frankly , the pursuit of the normal of the potential .
The opportunity for the greatness , the progress and change dies at the time we 're trying to be like others .
Please , I do n't tell me that I 'm normal .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the middle of the Honduras .
Penn State asked me , a professor of communications , who gave a kind of communication to engineering students .
He was scared . They 're going to be able to get out of these students with their big minds , their big books and the big and unknown words .
But in the middle of those conversations , I sat down , and I felt like it must have sense when they fell through the shelf and saw the door of a new world .
So I sat up when I had those conversations with students , and I was surprised the ideas they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world .
And I think that the key to open that door is a great communication .
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing the world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges , from energy to environment and health care , and if we do n't know , and if we do n't know this , the work is not done , and I think it 's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions .
But these great conversations ca n't happen if our scientists and engineers do n't invite us to see their wonderful world .
So scientists and engineers , please do <unk> .
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that we can see that its science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive .
First question for <unk> , and then what ?
It 's why science is relevant for us .
We do n't just tell us that we 're looking at <unk> , but that we study the <unk> , which are the mesh structure of our bones because it 's important to understand and try it .
And when they 're describing their science , carefully with the jargon .
The jargon is a hurdle for our understanding of their ideas .
Sure , you can say , `` space and temporary , '' but why not to say , `` space and time , '' which is much more accessible to us ?
It 's not the same thing that make them stupid .
Instead , as Einstein said , it 's all as simple as possible , but no simple .
They can communicate clearly their science without to engage ideas .
Something to consider it is to use examples , stories and analogies . They 're ways of <unk> and <unk> with its content .
And I 'm going to make her work , forget about the signs of `` bullet . ''
You 've asked why they 're called `` bullets , '' which they do the bullets , and they will kill her presentation .
A <unk> like this is not just boring , but it 's going to be too much in the area of the language of our brain , and it takes us .
Instead , this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective . It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the Eiffel Tower .
The trick here is to use a simple phrase , you 're going to argue , that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit , and , next , you can provide graphs that we 're going to give our other senses and believe a more profound sense of understanding of what it describes .
I think these are just some key that you can help the rest of you open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering .
And so scientists and engineers , when you 've been solved this equation , all the media , <unk> with <unk> . Thank you .
One of my favorite words of all of my favorite words of the entire adult English is `` <unk> . ''
Just because it sounds very well .
And `` <unk> '' means `` political political . ''
Although there was a 21st-century editor of the 19th century that the way a lot better when he said , `` A <unk> , '' is that it 's looking for a public charge , no matter , platform or principle , and that , when he wins , it 's got for the ultimate <unk> of a monumental <unk> <unk> . ''
I have no idea what it means `` <unk> . ''
Something to do with words , I guess .
It 's very important that words are the basis in politics , and that all the politicians know they have to try to preserve the language .
It was n't until , for example , <unk> that the British Parliament were allowed to quote the exact words that were saying in the parliamentary camera .
And all of this was because of the courage of a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> , who went to Parliament .
He told him in the 19th Tower of London , and he went on , but he had enough courage to deal with them , and at the end , it had a popular support in London that won .
And just a few years later , we had the first use of the <unk> of the phrase , `` So <unk> that <unk> . ''
Most people think it 's right .
It 's not . It 's because of the freedom of expression .
But to show you how words and politics interact , I want to go back to the United States , just after independence .
So , they had to address the question of how to call George Washington , his leader .
They did n't know .
How do you call the leader of a Republican country ?
This was reported in Congress for a long time .
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk> .
Some of them wanted to call it , `` Oh , I 'm going to say , `` His name of George Washington , '' and others , `` His <unk> of the U.S. <unk> . ''
Not very attractive .
Some just wanted to call it `` King '' .
They thought it was a matter of <unk> .
And not even with it , they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a certain term .
And I could have worked .
All of the world was immensely , because this debate was <unk> for three weeks .
It was a poor day , and I 'd always write , `` still with this issue . ''
What caused the height and the <unk> was that the Indus House was in against the Senate .
The Indus House I did n't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
He did n't want to call him `` King '' because I would give him to him , or he gave her ideas .
So , they wanted to give the more modest title , more likely and more unfortunate that happened .
And that title was `` President . ''
President . They did n't invent the title .
It was like the president of a jury .
And I did n't have a lot more <unk> than the term `` foreman '' or `` Will . ''
There was a little bit of small <unk> <unk> , and I 'd really be a kind of a trivial title .
And that 's why the Senate is going on .
They said , `` It 's ridiculous , we ca n't President . ''
`` This guy has to sign treated and come up with foreign <unk> . ''
`` And who I 'm going to take it seriously with a <unk> , like the President of the United States ? ''
And finally , after three weeks of arguing , the Senate did n't help .
We can learn three interesting things about this .
First of all , and this is my favorite to where I 've been able to figure out , the Senate has never been <unk> as a President of President .
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there , waiting for the Senate between action .
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a government says that one extent is temporary -- it 's possible that we 're going to be able to stop waiting for <unk> years .
But the third thing we can learn , and this is the most important thing , and I want to leave you , is that the President of President of the United States does n't sound so modest today , right ?
It 's everything if you have more of 5,000 nuclear heads available , the biggest economy of the world and a fleet of <unk> vehicles and others .
And the reality , and the story have given to the title of <unk> .
So the Senate won the Senate .
They get your <unk> title .
And also the other concern of the Senate , the appearance of uniqueness -- well , was a uniqueness of then .
But , you know how many nations are now president ?
And everything , because they want to sound like the kind of nuclear warheads , etc .
So , at the end , the Senate won and the Olympic House , because no one is going to feel early when you 're going to say it 's the President of America .
And I think that 's the great lesson that we can learn , and I 'd like to leave you to leave you with you .
The politicians trying to pick up and use words to shape and control the reality , but actually , the fact , the fact , a lot more the words that they could change the reality .
Thank you very much .
I 'm 45 feet under land in a illegal mine of Ghana .
The air is heat and dust and it 's hard to breathe .
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the darkness , but I ca n't see much more .
I hear voices that they 're talking about , but , especially , that <unk> of male <unk> and stones , with primitive tools .
As the others , I take a cheap flashlight of light <unk> to the head with this <unk> <unk> , and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that we hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground .
It 's <unk> my hand and suddenly I met a pill that I met days before I met the control , and I fell back to a feet on that fat .
As I talk to you today , these men are in the deep side of that hole by putting their lives without pay , and , often , dying .
And I went home , but I went home , but they might never do it , because they 're slavery .
In the last 28 years years , I was documenting native cultures in the past six continents , and in 2009 , I had the great honor of being the only <unk> on the Peace Act .
Among all the amazing people that I met there , I met the <unk> of the <unk> , an NGO that 's done to eradicate modern slavery .
We start talking about slavery and actually started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world , but not as a degree .
When we finished talking to me , I felt very bad ; I was embarrassed to ignore this gorillas of our days , and I thought , `` How many people do n't know ?
He did a knot to the stomach and , weeks later , I flew in Los Angeles , to know the principal of the <unk> , and I gave my help .
So it started my journey to modern slavery .
Interestingly , there was a lot of these sites .
So , even , I looked at my second home .
But this time , you know , <unk> dirty dirty .
A conservative calculation says that now there are more than 27 million people in the world .
It 's twice the number of Africans displaced over the whole reason of slaves .
150 years ago , the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker .
The equivalent of a $ 50,000 billion dollars .
However , today , you can have a lot of entire families for generations for a $ 18 dollars .
Except , the slavery generates profits of $ 13,000 dollars a year around the world .
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work that they 're forced to work without paid , under threat of violence and ca n't escape .
Today slavery work in the trade , the goods produced by slaves have value , but they produce them .
The slavery exists in almost all around the world , and yet , it 's illegal around the world .
In India and Nepal , I met the furnaces .
This strange show , and it was like to go into the old Egypt , or to <unk> .
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C , men , women , children , in the entire entire way of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their head , until 18 to the time , and they take them out of the Russian furnaces .
They 're going to get it out by doing it , and they work in silence , doing this task , and again for 16 17 hours a day .
There was no <unk> to eat , and it 's not to drink , and the severe <unk> would make it just be a lot of fireworks .
It was also the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot by touch and stopped work .
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it would work with <unk> conditioning and , sitting there , I thought , my camera gets a lot better than these people .
On the furnaces , I wanted to cry , but the <unk> that I was going to my next hand , and he said , `` Lisa , do n't do it . Do n't do it . ''
And I explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions in places like this , not just for me , but for them .
I could n't offer any direct aid .
I could n't give you money , nothing .
I was n't aware of that country .
I could put them into a worst situation that they were already .
I had to trust the <unk> of the <unk> and work inside the system for their release , and because they 're going to do it .
In terms of me , I waited to get home to feel my heart Falcon .
In the Himalayas , I found kids with <unk> stones for the mountain and trucks that they were waiting down .
Those great films were more heavy than the children who were able to put them and kids put their heads on their heads , and they put them made of sticks made of sticks , strings and swallowed .
It 's hard to witness something as overwhelming .
How can we influence something as insidious , but as ubiquitous ?
Some people do n't even know that they 're slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life .
They do n't have anything to compare .
When these villagers would <unk> their freedom , the <unk> had been broken .
When you hear the word of slavery , we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global awareness , they felt that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business .
In addition to <unk> women who had been given sex .
It took me to a little bit of <unk> stairs that would give this dirty basement , <unk> light .
It was n't exactly a brothel .
It was more well a restaurant .
<unk> , as you know , they 're local prostitution for prostitution prostitution .
They have small rooms , private , where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children , some of the only seven years , they 're posed to support the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol .
Each of it is dark and dirty , identified by a broken number , and divided by a <unk> and a curtain .
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients .
You know , I remember , I remember a little bit of <unk> , and in that moment , I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell .
I just had a way , the stairs where I walked in .
There was no legs .
There were no big enough enough to climb .
Those people do n't have <unk> and , because we play a very difficult issue , it 's important to point that slavery , even the sexual traffic , it 's happening around us .
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture , in the domestic service and the list can continue .
So recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300 children are sold every year like sex .
It 's everywhere , but we do n't see it .
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of labor .
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the trade trade .
This is a picture of family .
The hands of the black <unk> , the <unk> of blue and red , of their children .
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels , and the silk is the silk in the liquid , and the essence is toxic .
My name told me their stories .
`` We do n't have freedom , '' they said .
`` We still hope , yet , we can go out of this house one day , and go to another place where we actually do our work . ''
It 's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children are going to put into the east lake in the world .
When we got , I went to a quick look .
I saw what it seemed like to be a fishermen family , two older brothers , some more young kids , makes sense ?
Wrong . It was all slaves .
Kids are separated from their Saudi families , they were missing and forced to work with a lot of the boats in the lake , in spite of not knowing .
This child has eight years .
When our boat came up to me , I was quivering , which his little canoe was <unk> .
I was paralyzed by the fear of fall into the water .
The <unk> branches of the trees to get in the lake , and they often make networks and children , <unk> and fear , they 're stored to the water for the branches .
Many of them are engaged .
Since they remember , it 's always been forced to work on the lake .
For fear of her love it 's not going to run out and , as all life has been treated with <unk> , they 're trying to get the most young slaves under their chest .
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning , when we gave the last networks , but they had been working from the one .
In the cold night and indirect .
And I would point out that these networks are getting more than 400 kilos when they 're packed with fish .
I want to introduce you to Billie .
Kofi was rescued in a village village .
I met him in a shelter in which I met the <unk> of the <unk> of slavery .
Billie is possible .
Who will be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life ?
It 's going to be <unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> , a fellow <unk> with his two-wheeler of a sudden , and he took our car and played our car and played the window .
We asked him to put it through a land path to the jungle .
By the end of the way , we 're going to be able to go out of the car , and he asked to the driver that came very quickly .
And then a single visible way , and he said , `` This is the way , this is the way . Let 's go . ''
As we started to go down , we took the <unk> that we put the way , and after walking close to a hour , we found that the way was <unk> by the recent rains , so I put the team of photos about my head to the extent that <unk> in these waters to the chest .
After two hours of walking , the <unk> path ended up in one of course , and we had to have a mass of holes that could be stored in a soccer field , and everyone was full of workers .
Many women had children who had children tied up and , as they were looking at the gold , they walked in <unk> .
Climate is used in the process of extraction .
They 're going to go down in a fat in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the clouds , they were stored in its own sweat .
I remember I looked at your eyes tired , <unk> , because many had been under land for 72 hours .
The wells have to 90 feet , and these people have heavy heavy bags , which then they 're going to be transported to another area in which we 're going to get the stone to be able to extract the gold .
In the first view , the site seems to be filled with strong and <unk> , but , if you look closer to close to , we see it working at other fortunate less fortunate and also children .
They 're all victims of injury , diseases and violence .
In fact , it 's very likely to be able to be able to end up like this one of the tuberculosis , and the <unk> of flooding in a few years .
This is <unk> . When he died his father his uncle took him to work with him .
When they die his uncle , <unk> the debt of the uncle what the force to be slave in mines .
When I met him , I had been working on the '50s , 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is product of an accident in the mine , so serious that the doctors were saying that the doctors were going to be .
In addition to that , <unk> has <unk> , but that 's forced to work night and day in that mine .
And yet , he 's going to be released and sell with the help of local activists as <unk> the <unk> , and it 's this kind of determination , the face to a remote possibility , which was inspired me a lot .
I want to drop light on slavery .
They knew that their images would be seen for you in the world .
I wanted to know that we knew that we 'll give testimony of them , and that we 're going to do everything to help change their lives .
I mean , if we can see ourselves about others as human beings , then it 's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
These images are not a magazines . They 're people , real people , like you , and like me , they deserve the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There 's no day that happens that I do n't think about these so many beautiful people , psychologically , I 've had the great honor to meet .
I hope that these images have to get a force in that you see , in people like you , and I hope that that force would turn a fire and that that fire turned out about slavery because , without that light , the beast of slavery can continue living in the shadows .
Thank you very much .
I do applied math , and there 's a peculiar problem for them , we 're like the palm of management .
Nobody knows what the hell we do .
So I 'm going to try and explain to explain what I do .
The dance is one of the most human activities .
We 're going to get the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> that we 'll see more ahead .
But the ballet demand a big training degree , a high level of skill , and probably a very initial indication that you can have an genetic component .
Unfortunately , chronic disorders like Parkinson 's disease , which is what 's done with my friend <unk> <unk> that , in his time , was a virtuous dancer dancer .
In the last few years , it 's done a lot of the treatment .
However , there are <unk> million people in the world that are sick , and they have to deal with a incurable membrane , tremor , modify and other symptoms of this disease , so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
We need to be able to measure the progress of the objective , and ultimately , the only way we 're going to know if there 's really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk> .
But it 's frustrating that for Parkinson 's and other disorders of the movement , there is no biological markers , and that 's why they do n't serve the blood analysis and the best that we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes .
You have to go to a clinic to do it . It 's very , very expensive , and that means that , outside of clinical trials , you 're never done . Never have done .
And what if patients could do it in home ?
That would save a trip to the clinic , what if patients could be done the test themselves ?
It would n't be personal .
By the way , it costs about 300 300 dollars .
So , what I want to tell you as a good way to try , you see , in some sense at least , all of us are <unk> as my friend <unk> <unk> .
This is a video of the vibration .
It shows somebody healthy as it emits sound to speak . We can imagine as a dancers of a vocal ballet ballet because we have to coordinate all these vocal organ to produce sounds and all of us have the genes required .
And , as the ballet , it requires a great training level .
So let 's think about time it takes a child to learn .
From the sound of sound , we can track the position of the vocal strings as you can , and as Parkinson 's affects the limbs , also affect the vocal organ .
In the bottom of the bottom , you can see an example of <unk> <unk> .
We see the same symptoms .
<unk> , weakness and map .
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while , and this is an example of the symptoms .
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical clinical trials ? Well , both of these are no invasive .
The neurological test is not invasive . They both use infrastructure .
It 's not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals to make them .
They are both accurate . Okay , but also the tests based on voice .
I mean , they can be <unk> .
They do very quickly , they take about 30 seconds as a lot .
They 're very likely , and we all know what happens .
When something takes a cost as low , it looks like mass scale .
These are some amazing goals to address .
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties .
You do n't need to go to the clinic for a routine .
It 's very often , we could get goals .
We could do a massive deal with a cost for clinical trials , and for the first time , <unk> focus on a general scale .
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first piece of the disease before it 's too late .
So , I 'm going to give the first steps in that sense , we 're looking at the Parkinson 's <unk> .
It 's <unk> and <unk> , we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start address these goals .
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world .
Anybody , with Parkinson without Parkinson 's , it can call it under a price , and I 'm going to stop recordings for a few cents , and I 'm happy to announce that we 've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours .
Thank you . Tom Rielly : So Max , taking all these samples of , say 10,000 people , you can say who 's healthy and who does n't ?
What are you going to take from these samples ?
Max : Yeah . What happens is that during the call you have to say if you have or not the disease . TR : Sure .
<unk> : You know , some people can do .
But we 're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances , and do it in different circumstances , it 's important because we 're looking for <unk> <unk> factors for the disease of the disease .
TR : You have 86 percent precision at this moment ?
<unk> : Many more than that .
In fact , my <unk> student , I have to <unk> , has done a fantastic job , and now it 's shown that it works on the mobile telephony network , also , what we 're going to do the project . We have a 99 percent precision .
TR : All and nine . Well , it 's a improvement .
<unk> : Of course .
TR : Thank you very much . A lot .
<unk> : Thank you , Tom .
Before March , 2011 , I was making <unk> <unk> in New York City .
We 're <unk> creatures , gray .
We <unk> in the darkness , in rooms without windows and , by the general , we get the sunlight .
We 're going to make the thin wireless models , the perfect skin , even more likely we do the impossible , possible , and you get them in the press all the time , but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for the images and photography .
The 11th of 2011 , I saw from my house , the same as the rest of the world , the tragic events that happen in Japan .
Little time later , an organization where it was voluntary , <unk> <unk> , was in the place working as a part of the answer .
I , along with hundreds of other volunteers , we knew that we could n't stay sitting in home , so I decided to join the group for three weeks .
He went to <unk> .
It 's a small village of fishermen in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people , one of the first villages affected by the wave .
The level of water has reached over 24 feet of height and more than three kilometers out inside .
As you can imagine , the people was stored .
We take rubble of the channels and the carcinogens .
<unk> schools . We took the mud and let them go ready to be <unk> and <unk> .
It took tons of tons and tons of dead fish , spiritually , <unk> of the local factory .
We <unk> and loved .
For weeks , the volunteers like the neighbors found things similar .
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and cards .
They all did the same thing .
<unk> and bring them to different places of the people around the villages of all of us .
It was n't until then I realized that those photos created a huge part of the personal losses that that people had had .
As I was born from the wave , and to save their lives , they had to leave everything they had .
By the end of my first week , I started to help in a center of the village .
It helped us to clean the massive bathrooms , <unk> <unk> .
This place it turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of adding the photos .
And I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to <unk> the photos .
This was exciting and inspiring , I had heard the expression to think about the horizons , but it was n't until I get my horizons that something happened .
When you look at the photos , I found some more than a hundred years of years , and I could n't avoid to think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing .
So that night , I went into Facebook , with some of them , and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive , who knew we had to try .
So we started to paint the photos .
This was the first of all .
It was n't too excited , but where the water had <unk> the face of the child , and I had to get them with a lot of precision and a <unk> .
In the other way , that girl would n't have the aspect of it , and that would be as tragic as I have the classic picture .
Over the time , they get more <unk> , and they were needed more <unk> , so it walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people of 12 countries that was offered to help .
In two weeks , I had 150 weeks to join .
In Japan , in July , we took them to <unk> , a town in the north of <unk> .
Once the week we use our scanner to use our scanner in the temporary literature that had been stored , where people were going to hire their photos .
The time I would take in <unk> is a different story , it 's dependent on the <unk> of the photos .
I could press an hour . I could a few weeks .
I could have months .
This <unk> had to draw in hand using the areas that color and detail the water had n't destroyed .
I took a long time .
The water destroyed all these pictures of the <unk> , <unk> of bacteria , with algae , even with oil , it 's all along with the end of the time I continue to <unk> , for that <unk> , it was an important part of the project .
We could n't run the picture at least it was clean , dry and had been <unk> by his owner .
We were lucky to hand .
We 've got the guide of a remarkable neighbor .
It 's very easy to hurt the photos already .
As he said , <unk> , the leader of my group is like to do a tattoo .
You ca n't make mistakes .
The woman who brought us these pictures , very lucky to the photos .
I had started <unk> her , but she stopped when you realize it 's even more .
I also had a <unk> .
Without them , the images of his husband and their own face would n't have been able to reconstruct , we could <unk> the images in a single picture and a whole picture .
When they took their pictures shared something of his story with us .
A lot of colleagues of her husband found the photos in a firemen station between the debris pretty far from where I used to be his house , but his colleagues would take it .
The day of the tsunami , her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave .
It was going to go inside the water as the <unk> .
It 's just so small , not so small now , but their two children were in school , in different schools .
One of them was trapped in the water .
He took a week to find all his family and know that everyone had survived .
The day I gave her his photos his little married son .
To her , despite all of this , those photos were the best gift that I could do , something that he could go back , something that I could go back in the past , that I could never have been packed on the past day , when everything in his life changed or was destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1,100 volunteers had been together , <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up to hand , and they helped us to clean photographs of photographs , the great majority -- the great majority came to hands from their owners .
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to bring back to 90 families , hundreds of <unk> and <unk> .
For this time , we actually do n't spend more than $ 1,000 dollars in teams and materials , most ink for printers .
We took them constantly .
One picture is a memory of somebody or something , a relationship , a relationship , somebody wanted .
They 're <unk> from our memories and stories , the last thing that we 're going to do , but the first thing you 're going to be looking for .
This was about the project , to restore small pieces of humanity , to give someone their connection with the past .
When a picture like this is sent to somebody , not a huge difference in the life of the person that you get .
This project also produced a great difference in the life of the <unk> .
Some of them were connected with something bigger , give something bigger , using their talent for something that is not going to be thin models of perfect skin .
To end , I 'd like to read this email , the day I sent from Japan after six months .
While <unk> , I could n't avoid to think about people and the stories we have to have the images .
One in particular , a picture of women 's women 's women from the grandmother to the small child , gathered around a baby , I was moved , because a similar picture of my family my grandmother , my mother , me and my mother was born , I 'm going and my daughter was born .
In the entire world , in all the few , our basic needs are the same , right ?
Thank you .
Bina <unk> told us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that 's going through a apple in an exhibition in an exhibition of a second of second .
But now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion , but a trillion video per second .
I 'm going to give you a new kind of photograph , the <unk> -- a new technique that can create videos in a slow camera of the light .
And with that , we can create cameras that you can see after the corners of vision , and you can see the inside of the body without using X , and challenge the idea of camera .
If I take a laser carpet , and I looked at it and <unk> in a second <unk> , or it 's , in several <unk> , create a little bit of a half millimeter wide .
And that 's what of photons , that bullet , travel to the speed of light , and again , a million times faster than a common bullet .
If we take that bullet and this package of <unk> and <unk> in this bottle , how are those photons within this bottle ?
What is the way of the light in a slow camera ?
Now , all of this -- remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel .
But this video is 10 billion times , so you can see the light in movement .
It 's not <unk> this research . It 's a lot of things on this film , and we 're going to get this information to show what 's going on .
The pulse , our bullet , you go into the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> , and that , inside , starts <unk> .
Part of the light flies , it 's going to the table , and we started looking at these little bit .
Many of the photons finally come to the cover and then they exploit in various directions .
As you can see , there 's a bubble .
In that time , the waves travel through the table and because of the reflections of the drink , it looks at the bottom of the bottle , after several pictures , that the reflections are concentrate .
Now , if we take a common bullet and the current , and we do that the same distance , and we see it on a slow camera at about 10 billion times , how much think we would be going to be sitting going to see that movie ?
A week ? A week ? Actually , all of a year .
It would be a very boring film of a slow bullet .
And what could you do with a dead nature ?
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table , the tomato and the wall of the bottom .
It 's like to put a rock in a pond .
It 's the way the nature looks like a picture , I thought , from a <unk> , but , of course , our eyes see a fixed composition .
But if you look once more this tomato , you 'll realize that , as the light takes a little bit of tomato , still brilliant . It 's not <unk> .
Why ? Because the tomato is <unk> , and the light rotates in its inside , and it turns out after several <unk> of second .
In the future , when this <unk> is in their mobile phone , they 're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to play it .
Why do we create this camera at MIT ?
As photographers , you know , if we took a picture at low exposure , a very little bit of light .
But we 're going to take a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition , so you just get something of light .
We send that bullet , that 's a little bit of <unk> , millions of times , and we recorded one and again with a very elaborate angle , we take those data of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you .
We can take all those data in raw and <unk> a interesting way .
Superman can fly .
Other heroes can become invisible .
And if a new power of a <unk> future would be able to see after the corners ?
The idea is that we could put something of light on the door , <unk> , go into the room , a part of it is going to reflect on the door , and from there to the camera .
So we could extract those multiple <unk> of light .
It 's not science fiction . We 've already built it .
On the left , it 's our <unk> .
Behind the wall , there 's a gorillas and <unk> the light on the door .
Then of the publication of our paper .
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera , but interestingly , at a slightly different times .
And as we have a camera that works so fast , our <unk> , has unique capabilities .
It 's very good creative resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
So , we know the distances to the door and also even the hidden objects , but we do n't know what it corresponds to what the distance .
When I project a laser , you can record a picture in raw , which , it does n't have any sense .
But we 're going to take a lot of images like this , tens of images , and we 're going to try and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light , and with that , we can see the hidden object ?
Could we see it in 3D ?
This is our reconstruction .
We have things to explore the lab , but in the future , we could create cars that can avoid collisions with what 's going on the way .
We could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light windows .
Or we could build them able to see the inside of the body , <unk> <unk> , and the same thing for <unk> .
But , of course , because of the tissue and the blood is pretty difficult , so this is actually a asked to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new model of visualization to fix the problems of the next generation .
So , <unk> <unk> , he became science in art , a art of photographs .
I realized that every other data of data that we collect every time is not just for scientific views , but we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to matter science .
We create a new form of computational photograph with slow camera and code .
And look at those waves . Remember , the time between each one of those waves is just a little bit of <unk> .
But here 's also something fun .
If you look at the waves underneath the cover , these are going out of us .
The waves should move to us .
What happens here ?
It turns out that , as we 're recording almost the speed of the light , we have strangers .
The order in which happens the events in the world sometimes appears to the camera .
You know , they 're going to be <unk> in space and time , we can correct this distortion .
It 's already time . Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
A cell can change life , and gives you individual freedom .
With a mobile phone , it can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can tell a message , and starting a protest in Egypt .
With a mobile phone , you can record a song , and they 're going to go to <unk> and do famous .
All of this is possible with a cell .
I 'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the Berlin city .
Let 's go back to that moment , to this city .
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were looking for a change .
This is the fall of 1989 . Imagine if all of these people were willing to be looking for a change , they had a mobile phone in your pocket .
Who are a mobile phone here ?
<unk> .
Hands up , <unk> !
<unk> . A Android Android , an Android , wow !
It 's a lot . Almost everyone has a cell .
But today , I 'm going to talk about me , from my mobile phone , and how my life changed .
I 'm going to talk about this .
These are 35 <unk> lines of information .
Data data .
Why is that information there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the Commission of the E.U . I presented one .
The <unk> of data 's <unk> .
This means that every European telephone company , every single <unk> of the entire Internet , has to store a broad range of information information .
Who calls who . Who sends an email to who .
Who sends a text to who .
And if we use the mobile phone , where we are .
All of this information is stored for at least six months , and to two years , in his phone company , or the Internet provider .
And in all Europe , people stood up and said , `` We do n't want this . ''
They said they did n't want to do this .
We want to do the carcinogens in the age , and we do n't want the phone providers and the Internet providers , all this information about us .
There were lawyers , journalists , priests , everyone said , `` We do n't want this . ''
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who came to the streets of Berlin and they said , `` Freedom , not fear . ''
And some even they said this would be <unk> 2.0 .
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany .
And I also asked me if this works really .
Can you store all this information about us ?
Every time they use the mobile ?
So I asked my phone , <unk> <unk> , which was the largest telephone company of Germany , that please get all the information that you had about me .
I asked them once , and I went back to ask , and I did n't have a concrete answer . It was all blah , blah .
But then I said , `` I want to have this information because you 're <unk> my life .
And so I decided to get a bit of <unk> demand because I wanted to have this information .
But <unk> <unk> said not , we 're not going to give you this information .
In the end of them <unk> .
It 's <unk> the demand and they send me the information that I asked .
Meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the German law of the E.U .
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside .
And in the CD there was this .
Two and five thousand <unk> lines of information .
When I looked at you and said , well , it 's a huge file .
But after a time , I realized that it 's my life .
There 's six months of my life in this file .
It was a little bit bit , what did I do with that ?
Because you can see where I 'm , where I 'm doing .
But then I said , I want this information .
I want to make it a public .
Because I want to show people what the databases mean .
So , next to <unk> <unk> and New Data , we did this .
This is a visualization of six months of my life .
You can go back and go back and go back and forward .
You can see every step that I give .
And you can see what I 'm going to be in the train , and what I 'm going to call in the way .
All of this is possible with this information .
That day a little bit of fear .
But it 's not just about me .
It 's all of us .
First , there are things like , I call my wife and she called me , we talked a couple of times .
Then they call me some friends and they 're called between them .
And then you call the other , and the other one to the other , and we ended up with this great network of communications .
You can see how their people are communicating among what time they call some other , what hour sleep .
You can see everything .
You can see the centers , the leaders of the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what the society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control their society .
This is a model for countries like China and Iran .
This is a model to study the way of your society , because you know who you talk about who you 're talking to who , who 's a email to who , everything is possible if you have access to this information .
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe , and to two years .
As I said to the beginning , imagine if all of these people in the Berlin streets , in the fall of 1989 , had a cell in your pocket .
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest , and , if the <unk> had known who they were the leaders , this never happened .
The fall of the Berlin Wall , perhaps never happened .
And , in a consequence , it 's not the fall of <unk> .
Because today , the state agencies and businesses want to store as much information of us as possible within and outside the web .
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be a lot of it .
But the self-determination and live in the age , is not a contradiction .
But today you have to fight for the self-determination .
You have to fight for that every day .
When you go home , they tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and that 's not a fashion .
When you go home , they tell his representative that only because companies and urban agencies can store some information , you do n't have to do it .
And if I do n't believe me , they ask his phone company , what information stored from you .
So in the future , every time they use their mobile phones that they 're going to give them to remember that they have to fight for the self-determination .
Thank you .
Hi , what happens ?
It 's not enough .
Hi , what happens ?
I call me <unk> <unk> , and I 'm not <unk> , but I know the doctor that brought me the world .
I 'm going to get my mom six times in six different directions , <unk> the poor of me in the process .
As a result , I have a brain paralysis , for that <unk> all the time .
Look .
It 's exhausting .
And Muhammad .
It 's not genetic .
It 's not <unk> nor contract .
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins , although they 're .
It 's just about accidents , as the one that happened to me at birth .
Now , I 'm sorry , I 'm not a source of inspiration .
They sit wrong for me , because at some time of life , they have to be disabled .
We 're going to go back .
<unk> of Christmas , they 're in the mall , drive in circles , and what you see ?
It 's 16 degrees empty places .
And they think , `` God , can I be at least a little bit of you ? ''
In addition to , I 'm going to say , I have 99 problems , and the silos C. is just one of them .
There was a <unk> of oppression , I won the gold gold .
I 'm unemployed , Muslim , disabled , disabled and alive in New Jersey .
If you do n't feel better , maybe they should do it .
I 'm from <unk> Park , in New Jersey .
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same early ones .
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York , could .
Many people with a brain paralysis , not walk , but my parents do n't believe in the `` ca n't . ''
The mantra of my father was , `` You can , you can do it , dancing <unk> . ''
If my three older sisters <unk> , I 've been 19 .
If my three sisters were going to school school , my parents <unk> to the school system , and it was <unk> that I was also out , and if we did n't take all the note , all of my mother 's <unk> .
My father taught me to walk to five years to put my toes on their feet and just walking .
Another hacker that I used was to put a dollar in front of me for me to do it .
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong .
Yeah . The first day in the garden , he walked like a <unk> champion that has received a lot .
By growing , there were only my city in my city and were all of the family .
Now there 's 20 Arabs , and they 're still all of the family , I think no one realized we were n't Italian .
This was before 9/11 , and that the politicians would think about using `` I hate the Muslims , '' as motto .
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith .
However , it looked like a lot of it was a lot that died of hungry during the <unk> .
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months , without eating , so we 're going to get out of the dawn to a little bit easy .
I was running on Broadway .
Yes , in Broadway . It 's crazy . My parents could n't afford to pay physical therapy , so I sent me to my dance school .
I 've learned to dancing with forever , or that I can walk up with forever .
I 'm from New Jersey , and there we want to be <unk> , so if my friends were used to kill me , I 'm also .
And when my friends were going to go on the vacation vacation in the coast of Jersey , I was n't .
I was going on my summers in a war area , because my parents were afraid that if we do n't go back to Palestine all of the summers , we 're going to be <unk> in Accenture .
On the summer vacation , it 's often my father trying to <unk> , so I was able to give me out of deer , and I would give me warm legs on the back , I 'm going to be <unk> in the White Sea , and I remember that the water would get me my eyes and thought , `` It works ! ''
But the male cure was yoga .
I have to say that it 's very boring , but before I 'm going to do yoga , it was a fake of <unk> that I could n't put up .
And now I can hold on the head .
My parents would tell this idea that I could do anything , that no sleep was impossible , and my dream was to be in the General Hospital .
I went to college through the positive discrimination , and I got a scholarship to the <unk> , University of the state of Arizona , because it was in all the <unk> .
It was like the <unk> of the theater department .
They all loved me .
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent , I took the highest note in my classes , and also in their classes .
Every time I did a scene of the <unk> to my teachers <unk> .
But I never got a role .
Finally , in my last year , the <unk> decided to do a play called a very slow dancing .
It 's a piece of a girl with a girl .
I was a girl with brain paralysis .
So I started screaming to the four winds , `` In order to have a role !
I have a brain paralysis .
By the end , free !
Thank my God , I 'm free ! ''
I did n't get paper . They gave it to <unk> Brown .
I went to <unk> to the principal of the theater department , tears historically , like somebody had killed my cat , asking him why and she told me that I could n't do the scenes of risk .
And I said , `` Excuse me , if I ca n't make the scenes of risk , you ca n't make the character . ''
It was a role for that that literally had been born , and they gave it to an actress without cerebral paralysis .
The college was making my life .
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors for disabled papers .
When I graduated , I went back home , and my first half <unk> was like extra .
My dream became reality .
And I knew that it would be <unk> , `` He said , `` He said .
Instead , I was there as a pink thing , I did n't see it more than the neck , and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> did n't <unk> <unk> , not white , with disability .
It 's just <unk> to perfect people .
But there were exceptions to the ruler .
And I grew up looking at <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and all of these women had one thing in common : they were familiar .
So I did <unk> .
In my first day , I took famous New York City in New Jersey , and I never forget the face of the first comedy that took when they fell at the point that I was going to the height of the New Jersey , with a button that had an open-source , which had brain paralysis .
I worked in clubs of all the United States , and also in Arabic in the Middle East , without a veil .
Some people say I 'm the first <unk> of the Arab world .
I never like to hire the first place , but I know that you 've never heard that little nasty fan that says that women are not fun , and we find very fun .
In 2003 , my brother of another mother and father , Dean <unk> , and I 've launched the Festival of the New York City , right now in her <unk> year .
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> of the media , and then I 'm going to remind you to the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are n't <unk> .
It was much more easy to fight the challenge of the disability of disability .
My great opportunity came in 2010 .
I went to me , as I was invited to the news program , it has to play it back with Keith <unk> .
He went like it was a dancing dancing , I would give me a study , and they sat down in a wheelchair .
I looked at the principal , and I said , `` Excuse me , can give me another chair ? ''
She looked at me and said , `` Five , four , three , three . ''
And we were alive .
So I joined the desktop of the scenes to not go back on the screen during the segment , and when I ended up the interview , I was visiting .
In order , I had my opportunity and the <unk> . I knew he did n't come to me .
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to me , but I was in a complete time , and he was hit my chair .
A fun thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk> .
It says that children are cruel , but I would never get me out of me , not a little bit of me .
Suddenly , my disability on the Internet became an object .
I saw clips online , like , `` Why do you do it ? ''
`` Is it <unk> ? ''
And my favorite , `` Poor <unk> terrorist .
What does it have ?
We really should stop her . ''
So , a forgery suggested , even I 'd like to put my disability to my rsum : <unk> , comedian .
Aid is as visual as race .
If somebody in a wheelchair ca n't make <unk> , then <unk> ca n't make somebody in a wheelchair .
The disabled is the -- yes , man , man . Let 's go .
The disabled is the largest minority of the world , and the more <unk> in the world of entertainment .
Doctors said that I did n't walk , but I 'm here in front of you .
However , we have grown up with the media media , I do n't think it was .
I hope that we could create more positive images of disability in the media and everyday life .
Maybe if there were more positive images , that <unk> less hatred on the Internet .
Or maybe not .
Perhaps we need the whole society to teach our children .
My journey journey has taken me to very spectacular places .
I came to <unk> by the red red carpet , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to act on a film with Adam Adam and working with my idol , the incredible artist Dave .
You know the world , `` Arabs have become crazy . ''
I went into representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008 .
And I started `` The children of <unk> , '' an organization to give the children children , a part of what my parents gave me .
It was the only time my father saw me living , and I do this talk to his memory .
It 's called peace , Dad .
I call me <unk> <unk> , and if I can , you can also .
I 'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small village .
I do n't know your name , but I know his story .
He lived in a small town to the South <unk> .
This people is about <unk> .
The drought leads to the small people to poverty and the edge of deception .
Not anything for him , it 's going to the great city , in this case , <unk> , the capital of Somalia .
When it comes there , there 's no opportunities , there 's no opportunities , no job .
He 's just living in a tent in the city of <unk> .
After perhaps a year <unk> , nothing .
One day , you know , one day , you 've got to take it to lunch , after dinner , to breakfast .
It has been a dynamic group of people , which gives you a break .
He gets a little bit of money for you to buy new clothing , money to send home , to his family .
He presented a young man .
And finally , home .
It starts a new life .
It has a goal of life .
A beautiful day in <unk> , under a blue sky , it 's a bomb car .
That little child in that little town with dreams of the great city was the suicide terrorist , and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> , a terrorist organization connected with Al Qaeda .
So , how did the story of a child of a little town , trying to get their dreams in the city ends up with him <unk> ?
He was waiting .
I was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to start their future , waiting for a future of future , and this was the first thing that happened .
This was the first thing that he pulled out what we call `` the period of waiting . ''
And its story is in urban centers around the world .
It 's the story of the marginalized , young urban and unemployed , <unk> riots in London , who are looking at something beyond the word of waiting . ''
For young people , the promise of the city , the great dream of the city is the opportunity , of well-being , but the young people do n't participate in the prosperity of their cities .
It 's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment .
By 2030 , three of every five people who live in the cities are under 18 years old .
If we do n't include the young people in the growth of our cities , if we do n't build opportunities , the story of the `` period of waiting , '' the door of access to terrorism , to the violence , to the violence , to be the story of the city cities .
And in my city of birth , <unk> , 70 percent of the young people are unemployed .
70 percent do n't work , it 's not going to school .
They do n't really do anything .
I went back to <unk> last month , and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital , the hospital where I was born .
I remember , I 'm going to be at that hospital <unk> thinking , and if I would never have gone ?
And if I had been forced to be in that same `` period of waiting ? ''
Would n't be a terrorist ?
I 'm not really sure about the answer .
The reason I was in <unk> that month , it was actually going to be a little bit of <unk> leaders .
We 're going to be able to have a few <unk> leaders .
We sit and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges that face the city .
One of the young people in the room was <unk> .
He was at the University of <unk> , graduated .
There was no job , no opportunities .
I remember when he told me , because because I was a college college college , <unk> , frustrated , was the perfect <unk> for Al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
They were looking like him .
But this story takes a different way .
In <unk> , the biggest hurdle to get out of the point , as a streets .
<unk> years of civil war , they have completely destroyed the road system , and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize .
<unk> saw a opportunity and I rotate it .
It started a continuous company .
It started <unk> to the local residents who they could n't get them .
I bought 10 pill , with the help of his family and friends , and her dream is at some time to expand hundreds of pill over the next three years .
Why is this different story ?
What makes this different story ?
I think the ability to identify and take a new opportunity .
It 's the spirit of the standard , and I think that the standard of the standard can be the most powerful tool against the word of waiting . ''
They 're going to engage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for as powerful .
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
I want to talk to you about a young man who went back to one of my meetings , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
I was given to train some of the young people in the height of the business initiative and how to create a culture of the business initiative .
In fact , it 's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years , and until a little bit of a little bit , until he knew it came , if you wanted to , if you wanted flowers for your wedding , <unk> were from plastic sent from foreign .
If you put it to somebody , `` When was the last time you saw flowers ? ''
For those who grew up during the civil war , the answer would be , `` Never . ''
So , she saw an opportunity .
It started a company of <unk> and design design .
I created a farm on the outside of <unk> , and it started to grow <unk> and <unk> , which is as he said , could survive the hard climate of <unk> .
And it started the food <unk> , creating gardens in the houses , and now it 's working on the creation of the first public park of <unk> in 22 years .
There is no public parks in <unk> .
It wants to create a space where families , young people , you can go together , and , like he says , smell the pink pink .
By the way , he does n't get pink because they use a lot of water .
So , the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , the presence of Ron had a really profound impact in the young people .
They had never thought about starting a business .
They had thought to work for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , their innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
They forced them to look at their city as a chance of opportunities .
They tend to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that could be <unk> of change .
For the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges that face the city .
It <unk> medical solutions for local problems .
So , they inspire young people and create a whole big step , but young people need capital to make their ideas reality .
They need experience and orientation to bring them into the development and put them back in their business .
They 're going to give the young people with the resources they need to do , <unk> the support that you need to happen to the creation of creation , and you 're going to be able to be able to use it for the urban growth .
For me , the spirit of the spirit is something more to start a business .
It 's creating a social impact .
He 's not just selling flowers .
I think it 's selling hope .
His Peace Park , this is how it is , when it 's created , transform the way people see their city .
He took kids out of the street to help rent and keep the pill for him .
I gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the waiting period .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
So my suggestion is , to become the young people in entrepreneurs , <unk> and eat their inherent innovation , and you 're more stories about flowers and <unk> from the Peace that <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you .
I was about 10 years , and I went down with my dad in the <unk> mountains , an area <unk> north of New York City .
It was a beautiful day .
The <unk> forest .
The sun was going to make the Sun <unk> as a <unk> , and it 's not going to be the way that we 're going to , almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings in looking at that land .
We got to our camp .
It was a <unk> in a <unk> lake , when I found something horrible .
Behind the presence , there was about about four meters with the heart of black paper balls of aluminum paper , and December old .
And I was very angry and incredibly confused .
So , <unk> that they were too lazy as to take out what they had brought up , who thought he was going to clean their garbage ?
That question went on with me , and it 's got a little bit .
Who clean our garbage ?
Do n't matter how to play or where we put the `` ours '' , who clean our garbage in Istanbul ?
Who clean our garbage in Rio or Paris or in London ?
Here in New York , the Department of <unk> our garbage , for 11 tons of waste , and two tons of <unk> products every day .
I wanted to know as individuals .
I wanted to understand who makes that work .
What does it feel like the uniform and bring that load up ?
So I started a research project with them .
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their pathways and I interviewed people in offices and facilities in the entire city , and I learned a lot , but it was still a <unk> .
It needed to go more more .
So I began to work like <unk> .
Now , it 's not just going to fly in the trucks . I did them .
And it was applied the mechanical <unk> and the snow .
It was a remarkable thing and a amazing learning .
They all ask about the smell .
It 's there , but it 's not as an awful thing as they believe , and in the days that it 's very strong , it 's been used quickly .
It costs a lot of <unk> to the weight .
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies , they 're getting <unk> the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every weeks .
It 's also the danger .
And according to the Office of <unk> <unk> , the loss of waste is one of the 10 <unk> of the country , and I learned the reason .
You 're going to go out and entering the traffic all day , and they 're looking at your around .
They just want to be <unk> , so the driver is not paying attention .
That 's very bad for the worker .
And also the waste itself is full of the dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible harm .
I also learned about the cost of the garbage .
When you go out of the <unk> , and you see a city from the back of the truck , you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself .
It never leaves .
It 's also just like a breath or the circulation .
They always have to be in movement .
And it 's also the stigma .
It seems to me that the stigma is especially ironic because I think strongly that the waste of waste are the most important piece in the streets of the city , for three reasons .
They 're the first protective of public health .
If you do n't get rid of the waste and effective and effective way every day , this starts <unk> of their tweets and their dangers that we 're going to be involved in very real ways .
We 've been controlled for decades and centuries , and then , we 're going to sprout and start <unk> .
The economy needs .
If we ca n't get rid of the old , we do n't have space for what the motors of the economy start to fail when it 's in danger .
I 'm not advocating for capitalism , just put its relationship .
And then it 's what I call our average average speed .
With it , I 'm just talking about the speed that they 're going to move in the contemporary time .
Usually we do n't worry about , nor put it up , and they 're going to go out , or we have our cup of coffee , our bag of <unk> , our water bottle .
We use them , we are we forget about them , because we know that there 's a work of work on the other side that 's waiting for it .
So today I want to tell you a couple of ways to think about the loss of waste that perhaps help the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human .
His job , I think , is almost <unk> .
They 're in the street every day , <unk> .
They use a uniform in many cities .
You know when <unk> .
And their job allows us to do our own .
They 're almost a way of relief .
The flow that keep us in except of ourselves , of our own waste , our <unk> , and that flow always must stay in a way or another .
So one day after September 11th of 2001 , I listened to a little bit of <unk> waste on the street , he took my small son and came down to my small son , and there was a man doing his whole journey of paper , and I had a man doing it all over .
And I tried to thank you for doing their work that day in particular , but I started cry .
And I looked at me , and he said , `` We 're going to be good .
We 're going to be good . ''
Little after that I started to investigate the team of waste and went back to that man .
It 's called <unk> , we work together many times , and we did good friends .
I want to believe it was right .
We 're going to be good .
But in our efforts , we exist on this planet as a species , we need to include and have to account all the costs , even the very real human cost of labor .
The heart waste , what we think about when we talk about garbage , represent three percent of the entire nation of the nation .
It 's a remarkable statistic .
So in the flow of their days and their lives , the next next to look at somebody whose work is to clean the garbage of you , take a moment to recognize it .
Take a moment to say thank you .
My work focuses on the connection to think about our new life , which architecture is born from the conditions and local traditions .
I took two recent projects like this .
Both projects are in emerging countries , one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia .
Also , they share the fact that different analysis of different perspectives become a essential part of the end of architecture .
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia , unchanged .
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example , my team and me , about what we had to design .
At principle , the first thing I thought was , `` I want to go out . ''
After looking at some of these buildings , there are a lot of these buildings there are a lot of the city , we realized that there are three different aspects .
In principle , these buildings are almost empty because they have very big shops that people ca n't afford to buy things .
Secondly , you need to use a lot of energy because the skin with crystals generates heat inside , so you need a lot of clean .
In a city that this should n't happen because it 's about a climate , which is about 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year .
And in third , it does n't have anything to do with Africa and Ethiopia .
It 's a shame for a place of a rich place in culture and traditions .
In our first visit to Ethiopia , I actually became the old market , which is this structure to free , where thousands of people , they 're going and buy things every day to small vendors .
That 's also that idea of using the public space to create external activity .
So I thought , that that was what I really wanted to design , not a mall .
But the question was how to build a new building , of several floors , applying these principles .
The next challenge was presented to the 1960s , which is located in one area of a lot of growth growth , where much of the buildings that we now see in the image , there was n't .
And it 's also between two parallel streets that do n't communicate in an extension of 100 feet .
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , they put all the entries on the building .
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the building that <unk> , by its own way , the Sun and rain .
And around this space , we 've applied the idea of the market with small businesses , which changes in every floor because of the form of space .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local local conditions .
And I went to thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> of concrete in the way to allow the air entry , and also from the light , but it 's a benign way .
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the Seven of the clubs .
They have properties of the fractal geometry , and this helped me to model the facade .
We 're building that with these little pieces of parts , which are the windows that you 're leaving the air and the light of a controlled way inside the building .
This is <unk> with these little crystals crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building for night .
With these ideas did n't be easy to convince the developers because they thought , `` That 's not a mall . It was n't what we asked . ''
But we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall is going to be much more profitable than the mall , because in the end of the bank had more local to sell .
And also the idea of the front idea was much more economic , not just because of the material in comparison with the glass , but it was also because it was n't necessary to have air conditioning .
So we get certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project .
The first thing was to think about how to do the <unk> of energy for the building in a city that the electricity is almost every day .
So we get a great advantage to put it into the ceiling .
And then under those panels think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and charges that create this urban oasis .
And these <unk> on the roof , that we set up water for the inside of the interior .
You wait for the early next year , because we 're going through the fifth floor of building .
The second example is a <unk> plan , and services in the city of Tunisia .
And to make a project so big , the bigger that I was designed , I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia , but also the environment , his tradition and culture .
During that analysis , I put it special attention to the <unk> , an structure of 1,000 years old , who was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access , connected by straight lines .
When I went to the place , the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets , creating 12 early blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these courtyards .
In addition to that , we can take a few political dots in relationship with the idea of the extra doors with straight lines , and this changed the initial model .
And the last operation was to think of the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as a essential part of the teacher plan .
I thought , what would be the best orientation for a apartment in the climate <unk> ?
And it 's a lot that creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation .
So , I 'm going to get a framework that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly .
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city .
It 's got these blocks with courtyards , and then in the open plant , we have all the connections for the pedestrians .
And it also responds to the local norms that set up a higher density in the upper levels and a lower density in the low plant .
And so we also deny this idea of the doors .
The roof , which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community to the community , the space of the construction .
It 's where all the neighbors , you can come up and come up , and they do something like running a two kilometers in the morning , or to jump from a building to another .
These two examples , they have a common approach in the process of design .
And also , they 're in emerging countries , where you can see the cities literally growing .
In these cities , the impact of architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies to the same rate that grow buildings .
So , for this reason , I see even more important to look at architecture , looking for simple solutions , which will improve the relationship between the community and the environment , and they have as a goal to connect nature with people .
Thank you very much .
When I was eight years old , a new child joined our class . It was so remarkable , as you see all the new girls .
I had a very brilliant amount of hair , and a little <unk> , and a little <unk> of pencils , cute . It was very strong for the capital of the states , very good to <unk> .
So I was full of that year , and I was filled with it , until I was going to be able to get my dam .
One day , I became a time after the end of the school , it was a little afternoon , and I wrote myself in the bathroom .
When the coast of the coast was <unk> , I went out , walked in the classroom , I took the table of my master 's book .
And then , I did .
<unk> <unk> .
All of the way , and I 'm going to give me to give you the book to the closet , but to see , some of my other classmates had very good notes .
So , in a pill , <unk> the notes around the world , without any imagination .
I put them back to every row of <unk> and myself , and I 'm just going to be there , because I could ...
I still surprise me what I did .
I do n't understand how the idea came out .
I do n't understand why I felt well doing it .
I felt important .
I do n't understand why I never got to me .
It 's that everything was pretty obvious .
I never found me .
But on all , I 'm going to tell me the reason why I was given to me that this little girl , so small , was so good for <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> .
They 're as <unk> and so <unk> .
We know that babies suffer with <unk> .
Also primates . The tiles are very likely .
We know that bats are the number one of the average , one of them in the United States .
And yet , I 've never seen a study that we can raise loneliness , or the long duration or the sadness .
So , you have to go to the fiction , because the novels are like the lab are like the laboratory that we 're studying , in all its possible ways .
In fact , I do n't know if it 's a exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> , <unk> would have no literature .
Well , I would n't have the <unk> of the <unk> , or there would be `` Flickr . ''
There was no king king , or `` A thousand and a night . ''
There was no Shakespeare .
It 's going to take you up the lists of high school school , because we 'd be losing `` The noise and the <unk> , '' I would n't have `` Jeopardy '' , '' and `` Dear K . ''
However , there 's no disadvantages . I know it 's a way of the answers to say , you have the responses for everything , and , in terms of the ideal , almost you have all .
This year , it 's been 100 years of his masterpiece , `` It 's looking for the most ambitious time , the most <unk> study of sexual and also the ordinary competitiveness , the whole thing that we could have , and thinking , we have the <unk> details , right ?
We thought , in a child trying to get the sleep .
We thought about a <unk> <unk> .
We forget about how hard it is .
We forget about the question that is .
I mean , it 's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were so hard as <unk> .
I do n't know how the <unk> of the cat , but we assume it 's <unk> .
So let 's see why they 're going to go so well together , the novel and the smell , and you know , and it 's an awful thing .
It will be very obvious as the crabs , that you get to the person , to their desire , are a very solid narrative basis ?
I do n't know , I think we got very close from the bone , when we think about what happens when they feel properly .
When we feel heavy , we count ourselves a story .
A story about life of other people , and those stories makes us feel terrible because they 're designed for that , to make us feel bad .
It 's going to every day , and audience , we know exactly what details to include , to send the knife , right ?
<unk> do it all of these amateurs imitation , and that 's something I understood .
All that she makes to give me pleasure to another , maybe right now . ''
And you start saying , I know the same story , and since then , Proust says that every cool <unk> that <unk> <unk> in his lover , it takes him to his collection of instruments in its private camera .
You have to admit that we 're going to be able to be able to say , <unk> , they were pretty counterintuitive .
You know , you know , we 're standing out , you would have to leave the country , if they wanted to break with him .
But you do n't have to be so excited to recognize that it 's a hard work . Right ?
<unk> are <unk> .
It 's a hungry emotion . You have to fly .
And how are the ideal ?
It 's <unk> from the information .
<unk> use the details .
It 's like the great amount of bright hair and the cute and small <unk> .
It was <unk> of the photos .
It 's why Instagram is so successful . Does n't be a <unk> language of <unk> .
When you 're going to <unk> it in their <unk> , suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the rectangles of his lover , then defends those behaviors .
He says , `` Look , I know that this is <unk> , but it 's not different to the interpretation of a old text or to look at a monument . ''
He says , `` It 's research with real value value . ''
It 's trying to prove that the smells are <unk> , and they do seem to be <unk> , but , in its heart , they 're search for knowledge , search for the truth , a painful truth . In fact , to what it does , the more painful reality .
The pain , the humiliation , the loss , the loss , you 're the way to wisdom 's wisdom .
He says , `` A woman who we need , that makes us suffer , causes it to us a lot of more profound feelings and vital that a wise man who can be interested in . ''
Is it saying that we 're going to look for young women ?
No . I think it 's trying to say that the meaning of us would tell us that we can tell ourselves .
And there is any other excitement that we do to be able to do this particular way ?
Is there any other emotion , and you 're going to give us our aggression , our horrible ambition and our rights ?
Have any other emotion that shows us to look at so peculiar ?
Freud would write about this later .
One day , Freud was visited by a young young young young young man who 's used to be used to the idea that his woman 's <unk> .
And Freud says that there was something strange in that man , who did n't get into what his wife did .
Well she was innocent ; everyone knew .
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause .
But he was looking for things that he would make his wife , without to notice , particles .
Would it be too much ? Or , accidentally <unk> with a man ?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife .
It 's very good at this .
Now , the novels describe very well how the fibers are going to look at intensity but without precision .
In fact , as much of the most moons we are , we are more , more we become the fantasy residents .
And because of this reason , I think , <unk> have been doing violent acts .
It 's going to drive us to behave in a completely <unk> ways .
Now I 'm thinking about me , for eight years , I recognize it . But I 'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news .
A woman 's woman 's wife was captured by having a fake false account in Facebook since he would send messages to <unk> , horrible self , for a year .
For a year .
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend , I have to tell you that when or this , <unk> with wise .
Because , we 're realistic .
So what huge , though , <unk> , creativity . Right ?
It 's like novel .
Like a novel <unk> novel novel .
<unk> is one of my favorites .
She 's a very strange character and brilliant of the American literature .
It 's the <unk> of `` <unk> in a <unk> , '' and `` The <unk> Mr. <unk> , '' books that are trying to do the political , and once we 're in the sphere , and once we 're in the sphere , the membrane that separates what it could be , it can be <unk> .
Take Tom <unk> , his most famous character .
I took <unk> <unk> , or want what you 're going to get to you and <unk> what you ever had , and it 's under the floor , and it 's under the floor .
It 's a way .
But what do we do ? We ca n't take the route of Tom <unk> .
I ca n't give you the entire world , so as sometimes I wanted .
It 's a pity , because we live in times of envy .
We live in <unk> times .
Is we good citizens of social networks , where the currency is the envy ? Right ?
The novels show us the way ? I 'm not safe .
So we 're going to do what characters always do when they 're not safe , when they 're to a mystery .
So let 's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask them for <unk> .
When people think of them , they think about <unk> <unk> , that criminal genius .
But I 've always been asking [ [ unclear ] <unk> , the head of a rat <unk> , which need to be desperately desperately , needs the genius of craftsmanship , but it feels angry .
He sounds so familiar .
It needs their help , but it <unk> , and <unk> with bitterness in each one of the puzzles .
But as they work together , something starts to change , and finally , `` The <unk> of the Russian Six <unk> , '' once he feeds up , <unk> to all of your solution , <unk> it back and says , `` We 're not clapping , sir .
We 're proud of you . ''
And he says that there 's no person in <unk> <unk> that I would n't want to get your hand .
It 's one of the very few times that we 're looking at <unk> <unk> in history . It seems like this very emotional . That 's also mysterious , right ?
It seems like a problem as a problem of geometry , without emotion .
You know , in a minute , it 's the opposite side of <unk> .
The next minute you 're on the next minute .
In a sudden , <unk> is allowing that idea to be he <unk> .
Could it be so simple ?
What happens if it 's really a issue of geometry , just a question of where we allow us to be in relationship with the other ?
Well , maybe we do n't have to be <unk> from excellence .
We can <unk> it with her .
But I just like the breast plans .
So as we hope that that happens , we remember that we have the fiction fiction fiction .
It 's just fiction , <unk> .
The fiction was used to put it into the table .
And let 's look at what 's like , the sweet <unk> , the terrifying Tom <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the bad Marcel .
We 're in great company .
Thank you .
We used to solve big problems .
The 21 of 1969 , Pete was released outside of the Apollo 11 , and he went on the Sea of the <unk> .
Armstrong and prostitutes were alone , but his presence in the gray surface of a collective , <unk> process .
The Apollo program was the most likely for peace in American history .
To get to the moon , NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today , or four percent of the federal budget .
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
People , including the Apollo crew .
But before the Apollo program , <unk> , 24 men traveled to the moon .
He walked on the surface of the surface , of whom they sold after the death of Armstrong last year , is the most old man .
So why were they ?
Not a lot of a turn : <unk> kilos of old old old old old old <unk> , and something that the 24 <unk> later , a new sense of something and fragility of our common home .
Why were they ? The previous answer is , because the Kennedy president wanted to demonstrate the Soviets , that this nation had better rockets .
But the words of Kennedy in the University of Rice in 1962 give us a better idea .
John F. Kennedy : Some ask , why the moon ?
Why do we turn it in our goal ?
And they could also ask , why is it going to turn the highest mountain ?
35 years ago , why fly about the Atlantic ?
Why does it play him against Texas ?
We chose to go to the moon .
We chose to go to the moon .
We chose to go to the moon in this decade , and do other things , not because they 're simple , but because they 're difficult .
Jason <unk> : For the contemporary , the Apollo was n't just a victory of the West on the Cold War .
In the time , the most strong emotion was the <unk> of the <unk> of the powers of technology .
They were because it was something great power to do it .
The landing on the Moon came into a very long context of a long list of technological beings .
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane , penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis .
In the middle of the century , it 's <unk> , and I looked like smallpox .
The technology seemed to have been able to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called `` <unk> force . ''
For most of the history of mankind 's history , we could n't go faster than a horse , or a boat with a candle boat , but in 1969 , the Apollo level of the Apollo 10 flew to $ 40,000 kilometers / hour .
From 1970 , no human being turned to the moon .
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo five of the Apollo 10 , and the happiest optimism about the power of technology has evaporated up to see that problems that we can imagine that technology would be able to fix Mars , create a clean energy , cure cancer .
I remember at the fifth of the Apollo 17 .
I was five years old , and my mother told me that I do n't go to the <unk> tube .
I knew that this would be the last mission mission , but I was completely sure that I could see the colony in Mars .
So that 's what it happened to our ability to solve problems with technology , '' has become a common place .
We hear all the time .
We 've heard about the two day here , at TED .
It looks like the technologists would have turned out , and they were made taken with trivial toys , things like iPhone , applications and social networks , or algorithms that we can grow the <unk> .
There 's nothing wrong in most of these things .
They have spread and liberate our lives .
But they do n't do the big problems of mankind .
What happened ?
There 's a nonprofit explanation in Silicon Valley , that they 've been created that they 've created less ambitious companies that the years of the years that are going to give Intel , Microsoft , Apple and <unk> .
Silicon Valley says that the markets are the guilty , in particular , the incentives that <unk> capitalists use the entrepreneurs .
Silicon Silicon Valley says that the creation of risk , which is the creation of <unk> ideas for the <unk> of incremental problems or even false problems .
But I do n't think this explanation is good enough .
It 's mostly going wrong in Silicon Valley .
Even when the capitalists capitalists were in its high point without worrying about the risk , they were very small investment , <unk> investment that could go out in 10 years .
<unk> . You 've always had trouble to invest with benefit in technologies as energy , that they need a huge capital and that development is long-term . They have n't invested in the developing of technologies that we 're going to solve big problems because they do n't have a cold value .
No , the reasons why we ca n't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound .
Sometimes , we chose not to fix the big problems .
We could go to Mars if we wanted .
NASA 's even designed a plan .
But going to Mars would take a political decision that was a political decision , and that 's never going to happen .
We 're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth .
Sometimes , we ca n't fix the big problems because the political systems fail .
Nowadays , less than two percent of the energy consumption of energy from energy energy as the solar , wind and <unk> . Less than two percent , and the reason is completely economic .
coal and natural gas are cheaper than the solar energy and wind , and the oil is cheaper than the <unk> .
We want to want sources of energy energy that can compete on price . There are n't .
Now , technologists , the entrepreneurs and economists are agree about what policies and international treated <unk> the development of an alternative energy : mainly , a significant increase in the research and energy development , and some kind of control of the price of coal .
But there 's no hope in the current political climate that we 're going to see a energy policy policy of the United States or international treated that reflect that consensus .
Sometimes the big problems that looked at technology , it 's not not going to be .
We know from time , it 's a result of time of failure in the food of food .
But 30 years of research , we have taught that hunger are political crisis that affect <unk> food distribution .
Technology can improve things like the crops or the systems for the storage and <unk> food , but it 's going to be hungry as bad governments .
Finally , the big problems of times <unk> a solution because we do n't understand the problem .
The president Nixon was declared the war to cancer in 1971 , but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer , some famous resistant to the treatment , and only in the last 10 years , they seem to be found effective treatments and viable .
The difficult problems are difficult .
It 's not true that we could n't solve the problems with technology .
We can , and we should , but these four elements have to be inside , and the political leaders and the population must want to fix the problem ; the institutions must support the solution ; it 's actually really a technological problem , and we need to understand .
The Apollo mission , which has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems , with those criteria .
But it 's a <unk> model in the future .
We 're not in 1961 .
There 's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War , there 's no political , like John Kennedy who would be very difficult and the dangerous , and there 's no popular mythology of science fiction as the way to explore the solar system .
In general , go to the moon it turned out to be simple .
I was just three days .
And really , I did n't even get any problem .
We 're alone in our present , and the solutions of the future are more difficult to get .
God knows that we do n't have the challenges .
Thank you very much .
Well , I 'm going to talk about the confidence , and I 'm going to start <unk> ideas that they have about trust .
They 're so common that you 've become a lot of our society .
I think it 's three .
The first one , there 's been a great decline of trust , it 's a very <unk> belief .
The second is a goal : we should have more confidence .
And the third is one task : we should get trust .
I think it 's going to do it , the goal and the task are wrong .
What I 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a lot , a goal and a task , which I think a more clear idea about the subject .
First of you think , why people think that trust has gone ?
And if I think about the base of my own evidence , I do n't know the answer .
I want to think that it can have gone into a few activities or institutions , and that could have risen in other .
I do n't know .
But I can get to the surveys of opinion , and the surveys of opinion are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has gone .
When you look at the surveys in the time , there 's no evidence of it .
I mean , the people who are <unk> 20 years ago , primarily journalists and politicians , they 're still inspiring the same mistrust .
And the people who were very unhappy about 20 years ago , they 're still pretty safe : judges , nurses .
The rest of us are in the middle , and , by the way , the average citizen of the street is almost just half to half .
But is this enough evidence ?
What the surveys of view is , of course , opinions .
What else can you record ?
So what you look at is the generic attitudes that people rethink when you do certain questions .
Does the politicians ? Is that in teachers ?
Now , if someone would tell you , `` <unk> in <unk> ? ''
Would it be <unk> ?
You know , <unk> in the U.S. teachers ?
You probably want to say , `` To do what ? ''
And that would be a very good answer .
And you could say , when you have to tell your question , `` Well , I trust you in some , but in others . ''
Which is very rational .
In fact , in real life , we tend to raise the confidence in the way .
We do n't assume that the level of trust that we 're going to feel for a certain kind of official , official or kind of person , it 's going to be uniform in all cases .
I could , for example , to say that I trust in a certain school teacher that I know to give you the class of reading , but for no way to drive the school .
After all , I could know that it was n't a good driver .
I could trust my friend more opportunity to keep a conversation , but not , to hold a secret .
Simple .
And if we 've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way the confidence is to be done , why we do all that knowledge when we think about confidence in the most abstract way ?
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence , because they try to <unk> the good political trial in fact to trust it or someone .
Secondly , what happens to the goal ?
The goal is to have more trust .
Frankly , I think it 's a stupid target .
It 's not that the goal that I would <unk> .
I put more confidence in what is <unk> , but not what it 's not .
Now , ultimately , I 'm a lot of not trusting what it 's not reliable .
And I think that those people who would get their savings with the very active named Mr. Madoff , who then disappeared with them , I think , and I think , well , they were too confident .
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life .
It 's going to be deposited or <unk> , that 's the right target .
Once you say , you know , it says , yes , it means that what matters in first place is not the trust , it 's reproduction .
What it is about to do a trial about how reliable people are in certain ways .
And I think that we could do a trial , we 're forced to focus on three things .
Are you competent ? Are you honest ? They 're responsible ?
And if we find that one person is competent in <unk> materials , and it 's responsible and honest , then we 're going to have a very good reason to trust it , because it 's going to be serious .
But if you 're not responsible , we could n't trust them .
I have friends who are competent and honest , but I did n't start to take a letter to the email , because they 're <unk> .
I have friends who are very safe that you can do certain things , but I can see it <unk> their own skills .
And I 'm happy to say that I do n't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible , but extremely <unk> .
If it 's , I still did n't tell me .
But that 's what we 're looking for : Selam before trust .
The trust is the answer .
It 's what we have to judge .
And , of course , it 's difficult .
In the last few decades , we 've been trying to build out of building <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions , professionals , equipment and others , that they 're going to do more easy the task of judge its eyesight .
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect .
They do n't work as they should .
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> , and he said , `` Well , you see , the problem is that it takes more time to do the interpretation of the interpretation that I read . ''
And we find the same problem in all our public life , and institutional , that the accountability of accountability that is going to guarantee gratification and the evidence of trustworthiness , actually is doing the opposite .
What they do is make the work of people who have to make difficult tasks , like the midwives , <unk> that `` <unk> the boxes . ''
You know , you know all of you know the similar examples .
All of that , for the target .
I think the goal should be more opium , and that the things would be different if you 're going to be worthy of trust , and it 's <unk> to the people that we 're safe and if <unk> by determine whether other people , officials or politicians are worthy of confidence .
It 's not easy . It 's the trial , the simple action , the attitudes , what does n't do properly .
In third , the task .
They 're going to be able to rebuild the task to rebuild trust , put things around .
It suggests that you should rebuild the confidence .
Well , we can do it with ourselves .
We can reconstruct a little bit .
We can do it if they 're two people , together , trying to improve trust .
But the trust , in the end , because we give them other people .
You ca n't reconstruct what other people have given you .
You 've got to give you the benefit enough for you to trust you .
You have to be worthy of confidence .
And that , of course , is because you ca n't trick , usually , all people , all the time .
But you also have to bring them to <unk> evidence that you 're worthy of trust .
How ?
That 's a day , everywhere , it makes the common people , the officials , the institutions , very effective .
Let me give you a simple commercial example .
The store where I bought my socks says that I can give them out without giving explanations .
I put them up and give me the money , or I get them into the color of color that I want .
That 's great . I rely on them because they are very vulnerable to me .
I think there 's a great lesson on that .
If you come vulnerable to the other part , that 's a very good test that you 're worthy of trust and you have trust what you 're saying .
So , at the end , I think , what we 're pointing is not a very difficult thing to figure out .
So , what people believe is in the relations , and in that framework , you can determine when the other person is serious .
Thank you .
From the beginning of computers , we 've been working on the separation between us and the digital information , the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk> .
This separation has gone down , and more and more and more and more , as a bit of one centimeter , the middle of the glass of a tactile screen , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone .
But I ask me , and if there were no barriers ?
I started imagining how it would be .
First created this tool that you 've created in the digital space , so that when the strong <unk> against the screen , the physical body to <unk> .
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D , and surgeons can create virtual organ underneath the screen .
So , with this tool you break the booms .
But the two hands are still out of the outside .
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using all the skills of hands ?
In the division of Sciences in Nigeria , with my mentor <unk> <unk> , <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work .
So , I took a transparent bombsight with cameras to detect the fingers and the face , now you can raise the hands of the keyboard , to get inside the 3D space , and grab it right directly with your hands .
As the windows and archives have a location in the real space , <unk> is so easy to grab a book of a shelf .
You can look at the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that there are on every floating screen .
The architects can be stored or rotate their models directly with the hands .
In these examples , we 're wearing in the digital world .
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come to us ?
Well , many of us would have bought and go back to the Internet .
Now that does n't have to worry .
What I have here is a virtual <unk> of the Internet .
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body .
If we take this idea more far , I thought , instead of just looking at the space in the space , how we can make physical , so we could touch them and feel ?
How would it be a future ?
In the Media Lab of MIT , I 've got my cousins , and my collaborator <unk> , we created this single physical company .
So , this tempting magnet is a kind of <unk> in the space in the space , which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space .
<unk> , what we did was to adopt gravity and control the movement through a combination of MRI , <unk> mechanical and detectors .
And when we consider the thing , the object , we 've taken it from the restrictions of the time and the space , what you want to say , human movements can <unk> and go back and stay in the physical world .
You can teach them physically physically and a distance , and the famous one of Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality , sometimes we wanted .
The students can use it as a tool to understand complex concepts like the movement of the planets , physics , and , unlike the <unk> or the textbooks , this is a real experience and palpable that you can play and feel . It 's very powerful .
But what 's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities .
As you can see , the digital information is not just going to show us something , but they start to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to be able to get rid of our world .
So we started talking about a barrier , but if we adopt that barrier , the only limit that 's being our imagination .
Thank you .
I 'm going to be <unk> for two years in <unk> , China , in the 1970s .
When I was in first grade , the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all the revenues .
But my mother said , `` No . ''
My parents wanted me to become engineering , like them .
Then to survive the Cultural Revolution , they create firmly that there was just an accurate path to happiness : a safe work and <unk> .
No matter if the job I would like , or not .
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer .
This was me , in my imagination .
A opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn , so I tried everything I could go to the opera school .
And so I wrote to the director of the school and the show of a radio program .
But to no adult , you know the idea .
No adult took me .
Only my friends had to me , but they were children , without authority , like me .
So , at the age of 15 years , I knew it was too much higher to train .
My dream would never work .
I was going to be afraid that during the rest of my life , one of a second class was the only thing that I could aspire to .
And this was so unfair .
So I decided to look for another calling .
Nobody around me wanted to teach me , OK .
Let 's go to the books .
[ `` Dear <unk> . ''
So they were banned in China , of course .
`` The Good Earth , '' it 's about life <unk> .
And it 's not a real propaganda .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
That 's a topic for another day .
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation , `` <unk> your father and your mother . ''
`` <unk> , '' I said , `` It 's so different , and a lot better to obey . ''
So it became my tool to go out of this message to go out of this trap , and to take the relationship with my parents .
I find it with a new culture , it was also a whole place to my perceptual habit .
Let 's take a lot of perspectives .
So for example , this map seemed to me , because this is what the students in China learn .
I 'd never have happened , that China did n't have to be in the center of the world .
A map involves the perspective of people .
It 's not something new .
It 's a common practice in the academic world .
There is to research in research as a high-tech religion and literature .
And so we 're going to make the academic understanding of the academic understanding of a topic .
And I thought that if you know , if you 're engaged in to investigate , why do n't we do it also in everyday life ?
So I began to read books from two .
It 's going to be people with the people , `` Benjamin Franklin . ''
For the case , the motion are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Buddha , they 're all psychological : lust , fear and social skills -- interesting .
If you know other language , it 's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages .
[ `` The route of <unk> Tzu '' Alan Alan <unk> ] in the workplace , I found that you can make a lot of her .
For example , it 's through the translation that I realized that `` happiness '' in Chinese literally means `` happy joy . '' Ha !
And `` girlfriend '' in Chinese , literally means `` new mother . ''
The books were opened up a magic door to connect with people in the past and the present .
I know that I would not get to feeling alone or powerless .
Having a dream really , it 's really not much compared to what many other people have suffered .
I 've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream .
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that they come from the dreams , where the passion comes from , where the happiness comes .
To a dream , I can do that for you .
And it 's because of the books , which I 'm here , happy , living again with purpose and clarity , most of the time .
So , the books always join you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
When I was in my <unk> , I saw my first client of psychotherapy .
I was a hero in <unk> psychology in Berkeley .
She was a woman named Alex .
Alex went back to the first session , using him , and a <unk> <unk> , went on the couch of my office , took the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about their problems with men .
When I listened to this , I felt so upset .
My roommate had a <unk> as the first client .
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men .
I thought I could do it .
But I did n't .
With the <unk> stories that Alex came to the sessions , it was easy to just move the head while they 're going to get the solution .
`` Men are the new new , '' saying Alex , and so I saw it , she was right .
You start working after , you have kids later , it has children after death happens after .
So for you just like Alex , and I had time for a few time .
But a little bit later , my supervisor gave me to press Alex who would talk about his loving life .
I was stored .
I said , `` Of course , it 's coming out of the bottom of the category , you 're stored with a head , but it 's not as if it was married with him . ''
And then my supervisor said , `` No , no , but maybe they 're married to the next .
Also , the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they 're married . ''
This is what psychologists call a `` Aha ! ''
It was when I realized that the '30s are not new <unk> .
Yeah , people sit head after what they 're used , but this did n't have the <unk> of Alex were a break in its development .
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment , and we were throwing it out .
So I realized , that this kind of implants was a real problem , and I had real consequences , not only for Alex and his loving life , but for the careers , the families and the future of all sides .
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today .
This means 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think no one comes to you before the <unk> .
Hands up if they 're in their <unk> .
I want to see the bottom of here .
Oh , yes ! They 're amazing .
If they work with <unk> , they love a <unk> , I want to see , I want to see . It 's good . Incredible , the <unk> of the truth matter .
This is not just my opinion . These are facts .
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to 35 years .
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and times , `` Aha ! '' He gives her life in your life , you might have happened to be 30 and so many .
People of 40 , they do n't go in panic .
This audience is going to be well , I think .
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that they will .
We know that more than half of Americans are married , they live , or they 're coming out with their future couple to 30 years .
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for the age , which means that if there 's something that you want to change themselves , now is the moment to change .
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> that in any other time of life , and we know that the female fertility comes to the top to the 28 , and things become complicated to 35 .
The <unk> are the time to move on your body and their choices .
When we think about the development of the child , we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain .
It 's a moment that his everyday life has a <unk> impact on the person who will be .
But what we do n't hear is that there 's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in an adult development .
But this is not what you 're going to be listening .
The newspapers talk about changes in the time of the time .
The researchers call them a extended adolescence .
The journalists would be <unk> names like `` <unk> '' and `` <unk> . ''
It 's true .
As culture , we 've considered a little bit of what 's actually the decade that defines night .
Arabs said that to make great things , you need a plan and not enough time .
It 's not true ?
What do you think it happens when you give you a little bit of your head on the head , and they say , `` You have another 10 years to start your life ? ''
Nothing happens .
It gets up to that person , the sense of urge , and its ambition , and it 's not absolutely anything .
And then every day , it 's really smart , interesting as you or their children and daughters come to my office and they say something like this , `` I know my boyfriend is not good for me , but this relationship is not going . I 'm not killing time . ''
Or they say , `` They 're all going to start a career before the 30 , everything will be good . ''
But then you start to sound something like this , `` My <unk> are <unk> , and I still have nothing to show .
I had better believed the day I graduated from college . ''
And then you start to sound something like this , `` My dating during <unk> were like the game of the chairs .
All they were running and <unk> , but then at some time around the '30s , the music came out and all started to sit .
I did n't want to be the only one that you 're going to stop , so sometimes I 'm going to be married my husband because he was the closest chair when he was 30 . ''
Where are the bottom here ?
Do n't do that .
Well , that sounds a little bit right , but it 's not no longer , the risks are very high .
When you leave a lot of things for the '30s , there 's a huge pressure to the '30s and so many of starting a career , choose a city , choose a couple , and have two or three children in a long time period .
Many of these things are not compatible , and there 's research that they start to show , which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything of once to the '30s .
The crisis of the middle age of age , is not about buying the red sports car .
It 's about to tell you that you ca n't have the career you want now .
You know , you ca n't have the child that you want to do now , or you ca n't give a brother to your son .
Many <unk> and <unk> can see themselves , and me , sitting in the room , and they talk about their <unk> , `` What was I doing ? What was I thinking ? ''
I want to change what you 're going to change and thinking .
Here 's a story of how it could be .
It 's a story about a woman named Emma .
In 25 , Emma came to my own office because I was , in their own words , having a identity crisis .
He said , I 'd like to work in art or entertainment , but I still could n't decide , so I spent the last few years working like <unk> .
As it was cheaper , I lived with a boyfriend that was more skilled than ambition .
And in spite of living very difficult , his previous life had been even more difficult .
<unk> often in our sessions , but then he went to it , `` You do n't choose your family , but it can choose your friends . ''
Well , a Emma day , he got his head on his legs and I bought it for almost every day .
I had been able to buy a new shower for a table , and I had happened all the morning <unk> with their many contacts , but then I was looking at the empty space that follows after the words `` In emergency space , please call me . ''
I was the point of the eye when I saw and said , `` Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident ?
Who is going to take care of if I get cancer ? ''
At that moment , I was a lot of work , and I do n't say , `` I . ''
What Emma needed was n't a <unk> that we really need .
Emma needed a better life , and I knew that this was his opportunity .
I had learned very much since I worked with Alex as to only sit while the fastest decade of Emma was going on .
So , for the next few weeks and months , I said Emma three things that everything else , man or woman , deserves to know .
First of all , I said to Emma that I was concerned about that identity crisis , and <unk> capital of identity .
By the capital of identity , I 'm talking to do something that we add value to your person .
To make something that 's a investment in what they want to be after .
I did n't know the future of the career of Emma , and nobody knows the future of the work , but I know this : capital of identity creates capital of identity .
So now , it 's the moment for that work on the other side of the country , of that company that you want to test .
I 'm not going to rotate this <unk> exploration , I 'm stored the exploration that I should n't tell , that , by the way , it 's not exploration .
It 's <unk> .
And I said Emma to make jobs , and I would tell them .
Secondly , I told Emma that mental tribes are <unk> .
The best friends are great to take you to you at the airport , but the ones that they get together with friends with a similar minds , because they know , what they know , what they think , how they think , how they think , how they do .
That new piece of capital , that new person who 's going to go out , almost always come out of their closest circle .
The new things come from what 's called <unk> links of friends of their friends .
I know , half of you have a bad work or do n't have work .
But the other half not , and the weak links are the way of <unk> to this group .
Half the jobs , we 've been able to never publish the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job , not published .
It 's not cheating . It 's science of how information happens .
Finally , not less important , Emma believed that you do n't choose your family , but I know your friends .
This was true when I was growing , but as <unk> , Emma , Emma as soon as <unk> , and you have a couple and form his own family .
I said Emma that time to choose his family had come .
Maybe they think that the 30 is better age to sit out head than 20 or even 25 , and I agree with you .
But to choose the person to you that you live right now , or you 're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook , they start walking towards the ocean is not progress .
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have , and that means to be as <unk> in love as you 're in the work .
It 's got to be a conscious election of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or killing time with them to play you .
So , what happened with Emma ?
Well , we looked at that board , and she found a quarter of a cousin who was working in a piece of art in another state .
This weak bond helped me get a job there .
That work work gave him a reason to stop the boyfriend with the living living .
Now , five years later , it 's sort of special events in museums .
This married a man who chose consciously .
It loves his new career , love his new family , and I 'm sending a letter that was saying , `` Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not great enough . ''
The story of Emma can sound easy , but that 's what I love to work with it .
It 's very easy to help them .
We 're going to be like aircraft that go out of the airport of Los Angeles airport , which is going to some place of the West .
Right before the past , a light fit in its journey makes the difference between land in Alaska , or there .
In the same way , the 21 or even 25 and even at the 29 , a good conversation , a good break , a good TED Talk , can have huge effects in the years , or even in the future generations .
Here 's my whole idea of spread to everyone you know .
It 's so simple as what I learned to say to Alex .
It 's what I have to have the privilege to tell you as Emma every day , <unk> are not the new <unk> , <unk> his adult , you get their <unk> links , you use their weak links , take their own family .
You 're not going to be defined by what they did n't know or what did n't do .
They 're telling your life today .
Thank you .
When I was 27 years old , I left a very <unk> job for a work that was even more likely to <unk> : the hut .
I went to teach you mathematics to seventh grade school schools in New York City .
And as any professor , I made tests and tests .
I gave them tasks .
When the work would come back , <unk> the ratings .
What I called me the attention was that it was n't the only difference between my best and my worst students .
Some of those who had a better performance , they did n't have a <unk> .
Some of my most intelligent children were n't going so well .
And that made me thinking .
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics at seventh grade , safe , they 're difficult : proportions , the area of a paleontologist .
But these concepts are not impossible , and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn if they worked hard and during the time enough .
After several years , I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a psychological perspective , from a psychological perspective .
In education , the only thing we know how to measure .
It 's the <unk> , but what happens if you have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn a quick and easy way ?
So I left the classrooms , and I went to college to become a psychologist .
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of challenging scenarios , and in every study my question was , who has successful here and why ?
My team of research and I went to the Russian French Academy .
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who <unk> .
We went to the <unk> of <unk> and try to predict what children would be possible in competition .
We study a functioning teachers working in slums , <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of those , who will be more effective to improve the results of their students ?
We associate with private companies , asking , what of these vendors are going to keep their own job .
Who is going to make more money ?
In all of those very different contexts , emerged a feature as an important thing of success .
And it was n't social intelligence .
It was n't good appearance , the physical health , and it was n't .
It was the determination .
The determination is passion and perseverance to achieve very long goals .
The determination is to have resistance .
The determination is to hold the future , day after day , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make that future one reality .
Aid is living life as if it was a marathon , not a career at all speed .
A few years ago , I started studying the determination of Chicago schools .
I asked thousands of school students who did my aspiration of determination and then waiting around a year to see who <unk> .
It turns out that kids with more determination had more likely to get more likely to graduate school , even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure , things like the family income , the results of physical tests , even security .
So it 's not just in West <unk> , or in the <unk> of <unk> , which matters , it 's also in school , especially for kids at risk of <unk> .
For me , the most powerful thing about determination is the little thing we know , the little thing that knows science about its development .
Every day , parents and teachers ask me , `` How do the determination for the children ?
What should I do to teach children a solid ethics ?
How do I get them motivated for the long term ? ''
The most honest answer is : I do n't know what they do is that the talent does n't explain .
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just do n't go ahead with their commitments .
In fact , in our data , the determination is not related to it , or it 's even related to the measurements of talent .
So far , the best idea I 've heard about developing the determination of the children is something called `` growth mentality . ''
This is an idea we developed at the University of Stanford <unk> , and it 's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , which can change with the effort .
So , Dr. <unk> has shown that when children read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow into response to the challenge , they 're much more likely to <unk> when fail , because they do n't believe that that 's a permanent condition .
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop determination .
But we need more .
And that 's where I end up my speech , because there are where we 're .
That 's the work we have in front .
We need to take our best ideas , our strongest intuitions , and we need to try it .
We need to measure if they have been successful , and we need to be willing to fail , to start everything again with the lessons that we 've been born .
In other words , we need to be certain about making our kids more certain .
Thank you .
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> , one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty , the way the shape of Chinese characters .
From that moment , I 'm going to be attracted to this incredible language .
But for a foreign , it seems to be as severe as the Great Wall Street .
In the last few years , I 've been wondering if I can put up this wall , so that so I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it .
I started thinking about how a new method and quick to learn Chinese could be useful .
Since I was five years old , I began to learn how to draw every one of the strokes in the right sequence .
I learned that new characters every day for the next 15 years .
So we just have five minutes , it 's better than we do it in a faster and simple way .
An Chinese academic academic <unk> 20 thousand characters .
You just need to understand the basic literacy .
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature , enough to read signs of transit , gallons of restaurants , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers .
We start with eight to show you how the method works .
Are you ready ?
You open your mouth as possible until it 's a square .
They get a mouth .
This is a person who 's going to give a walk .
<unk> .
If the way of fire is a person with arms in both sides , as if it was screaming , `` <unk> ! I 'm burning ! '' This symbol actually is <unk> in the way of the call , but I like to think it 's about the other way , which will work .
This is a tree .
tree tree tree tree tree .
This is a mountain .
The Sun .
The Moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> doors in the old West .
I call these eight characters .
It 's building blocks so that they think most more characters .
One person .
If someone walks back , that 's `` Go . ''
As the old said , two are company , three are a crowd .
If one person saved his arms , this person is saying , `` It was so big . ''
The person in the mouth , the person is trapped .
It 's a prisoner , as <unk> inside the whale .
A tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have a forest .
Three trees together , we also have the forest .
You take a table under the tree , we have the foundations .
You take a mouth on the tree , that 's a `` idiot . ''
Remember the fire ?
Two together , it 's very hot .
Three of them together , that 's a lot of fire .
Take the fire under the two trees , that is burn .
For us , the sun is the source of the prosperity .
Two together .
Three together , those are <unk> .
You take the Sun and the dry Moon together , that 's the <unk> .
It also means tomorrow , after a day , and one night .
The Sun goes on the horizon .
A door . You 've got a table inside the door , it 's the gym .
Take a mouth inside the door , making questions .
<unk> , played someone in home ?
This person is coming out of a door , <unk> , <unk> .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they 're discussing .
Three women together , get careful .
So we 've already happened for almost 30 characters .
When you use this method , the first eight radical radical allows you to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters to build other 32 holes .
So with every small effort , you 're able to learn a couple of characters , which is the same thing that we learn an Chinese Chinese Chinese .
So after knowing the characters , we started to create phrases .
For example , the mountain and fire together , we have a mountain of fire . It 's a volcano .
We know that Japan is the land of the Sun .
This is a Sun put up with the origin , because Japan is to the east of China .
So a sun along the origin , we created Japan .
One person behind Japan , what do we have ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left are two mountains of the other .
In the old China , that meant in exile , because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains .
Nowadays , the exile has turned out .
A mouth who tells you to go out it 's a way .
This is a slide to remind you that I must stop talking and go down the stage . Thank you .
What I prefer to be dad , they 're the films that I get to see .
I love to share my favorite films with my children , when my daughter had four years ago , we saw the magician of Oz together .
The film is going to get his imagination for months .
His favorite character was <unk> , of course .
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand .
But when you see that film so many times , you get to understand that it 's extraordinary .
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex community .
However , the bat of Oz was an event itself .
It did n't start that trend .
And the trend really took a <unk> , <unk> years later with , interestingly , another film whose generation , a metal kid and a <unk> kid , <unk> a girl dressed as the enemy .
You know what I 'm talking about ? Yes .
There 's a great difference between these two films , there 's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the films that we see today .
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of Oz .
The monkeys are pretty aggressive , like the room .
But I think that if the doctor of Oz is doing today , the magician would say , Dorothy , you are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy .
You 're happy shoes to beat the <unk> of the <unk> of the evil <unk> .
But that 's not what happens .
Another single thing about the bat of Oz is that the most heroic characters , wise and even unpredictable are women .
I started to notice this when I did I 'm going to look at `` Star War II , a few years later , and the situation was different .
At that moment , I also had a son .
Only three years .
It was n't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that .
But it was the second son , and the level of the supervision had gone down . So , I was standing in the room , and I was impressed as a leg leg with her stones behind , and I do n't think he would understand what was happening , but I do n't believe everything .
I wonder what it turned out .
Would you be issues of value , perseverance and loyalty ?
Would the feeling that Luke is a army to finance the government ?
So let 's take this with the magician of 1939 .
How do they make Dorothy his film ?
<unk> <unk> with all and being a <unk> .
It 's the kind of world that I want my children to grow Oz , right ? And not a world of men who fight , which is where we 're .
Why is there as much an F of an F , the force in the films for our children , and so little on the way of yellow ink ?
There 's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence , and they should read it . It 's very good .
I have n't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus .
I know the experience that <unk> <unk> does n't give me the right framework that I would have been used to navigate the world of adults who 's a lot of , I think that at the moment of the first kiss , I really expected that the fishermen started to appear because it 's the end of the film , right ?
My search search , I have girlfriend .
Why are they still standing there ?
I do n't know what I should do .
The films are focused on to beat the villain and get your reward , and they 're not going to leave some time for other relations or other adventures .
It 's almost like it 's a child , you have to be a silly animal , and if you 're a girl , you have to use a suit .
There 's a lot of exceptions , and I 'm going to talk to <unk> <unk> to any of you .
But they send a message to children , even though , the kids , are not really their goal .
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to defend the patriarchy , but they 're not necessarily showing the guys how to defend the patriarchy .
There 's no model for them .
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children , so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> , but they 're not leaving films movies .
Of course , the most successful issue of all the time , it 's going to come up with classic after classic , every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are getting a child .
Until a lot of you are thinking , this year , finally came out .
I recommend all of you . It 's already available in shops .
Do you remember what the critical critical said when it came out .
I ca n't believe that Pixar has done a film of a princess .
It 's very good . I do n't let that stop !
Well , almost none of these films about <unk> .
I do n't know if you 've heard about this .
There 's no roots and it spreads , but maybe we 're going to start a movement .
<unk> <unk> is a mathematician of comics , and in the '80s , I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of the evaluation of the films that you saw .
And it 's very simple . There 's just three questions that must be done , in the movie , there 's more of a female character that has lines ?
So , you need to get the requirement .
These women are talking to each other moment of the film ?
Their conversations are about something else from the kid that you like , right ? Thank you very much .
Two women who are there and talk about it .
It happens . I 've seen it , and yet I see it in the film that we know and love .
In fact , this week , I went to see a very good film film , <unk> .
Right ? It 's a <unk> of Oscar , <unk> , an idea of consensus of what 's a Hollywood movie .
In fact , it does n't happen the test .
And I do n't think it was , because a lot of the film , I do n't know if you 've seen , a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden on during the world 's crisis .
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound conversations and painful in this epidemic , and it 's the great moment for one of the most likely to take a look at the door and say , `` You go to the bed , honey ?
This is Hollywood .
So <unk> in the numbers .
In 2011 , from 100 more popular films , how many of them believe that they have to succeed ?
It 's not wrong .
It 's not the same percentage that the number of women who have chosen recently for Congress , then it 's good .
But there 's a bigger number that this is going to hold this room .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
This is what he said .
In the United States , one of every five women , one of every five women says that it 's been sexually sexually free .
I do n't think it 's the guilt of mass entertainment .
I do n't think the films for kids have something to do with that .
I do n't think that the music videos or pornography are very closely respected , but something is wrong , and when I hear that statistic , one of the things that I think is there 's a great amount of sex .
Who are those guys ? What are they learning ?
What do n't you learn ?
They 're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to beat up with violence , and then they charge the reward , which is a woman who does n't have friends and do n't talk ?
So , we 're <unk> that story ?
You know , as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter , like those of you who are doing the same , we find this world and this very bold statistic and we want to <unk> .
We have tools to our current <unk> , and we hope that that will help , but I have to ask , <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if , at the same time , active or rigid , we 're educating our children to keep their male power ?
I mean , I think that the checklist is a way of doing something really important , and I 'm talking about the parents .
I think we have to show our children , a new definition of <unk> .
The definition of the box is changing .
You 've heard about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and <unk> .
Everything is changing .
When I asked my daughter to my daughter , what was his favorite image of Star Trek .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
What do you have in common these two ?
Maybe it 's not just the brilliant dress .
I think they 're experts .
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than no one , and I love sharing their knowledge with other people to get their potential .
They 're leaders .
I like that kind of stories for my daughter , and I like that kind of stories for my son .
I want more stories like that .
I want to be less stories when I tell my son , go and struggle just and more stories where her work is to join a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people to improve and be better people , like the magician of Oz .
Thank you .
In Maine , living in Maine and one of the things that I was looking at was looking for the sea cookies on the coast of Maine because my parents told me that I 'm going to be lucky .
But you know , it 's hard to find these shells .
They 're covered from sand and it 's hard to see it .
However , with the time , I was used to take them to look at them .
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk> .
This became a passion for finding things , in a love for the past and the considers .
And finally when I started studying <unk> , I realized that I see with my own eyes was not enough .
Because , of course , in Egypt , my little beach in Maine had grown up at a <unk> mile of length .
And my sea cookies had grown into the size of cities .
This is really what led me to use satellite images .
So to try to do a map of the past , I knew I had to see another way .
I want to show you one example of how different we see the infrared .
This is a place in the eastern River of Egypt called <unk> .
And the place , the simple view , it seems to be brown , but when we use infrared and we process it using a fake , all the place looks like brilliant pink .
What they 're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians .
I want to share with you how we 've used the satellite data to find a old <unk> city , called <unk> , lost for thousands of years .
It was the capital of the ancient Egypt for more than 400 years of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago .
The place in <unk> , Egypt , and it 's really important because in the Middle Empire , there was this great renaissance of the Egyptian art art , architecture and religion .
The <unk> have always known that I was located in a place close to the benefit of the two kings that built them , in the red circles here , but somewhere within this huge framework of proteomics .
This area is huge , it 's about <unk> per mile .
Before , the Nile <unk> right on the side of <unk> , and as it changed with the time , the entire city .
So how do you find a city in a large landscape ?
I 'm going to try to find the equivalent of the equivalent to a needle in a haystack , with the eyes , and using baseball gloves .
So , we use data from NASA to make a map of the place , with very subtle changes .
We were able to see where we 're going to get the Nile .
But you can see more closely , and it 's even more interesting , this very high area that looks inside the circle here , that we think could be the location of <unk> .
So we 're going to argue with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs ; you can see here .
When I 'm saying , it 's like the shots of shows in ice , but instead of layers of climate change , we 're looking for the human occupation .
Five feet down , under a thick thick layer , we find a dense layer of pottery objects .
This means that in this possible location of <unk> , five feet down , we have a layer of occupation of several hundred hundred years to come back from the Middle Empire , exactly the same period that we think is <unk> .
We also find jobs of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , which shows that there was a workshop workshop .
This could seem that it 's not a lot , but when we think about the most common stones used in the exact Empire of the Middle Empire , these are the stones that were used .
So , we have a dense layer of occupation that we 're going to come from the Middle Empire in this place .
We also have evidence to a workshop shop that shows that what 's been there , it was a very important city .
We still do n't find <unk> here , but they 're going to get it back to the place in a close future .
And even more important , we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of the satellite technology so they can also do great discoveries .
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire , probably was written in <unk> four years ago .
Learning knowledge is the most of all <unk> .
There 's nothing like that on the land .
So as it looks like , TED was n't taken in 1984 <unk> .
Do the ideas really started in 1984 <unk> in a lost city , not for a long time and found from the top .
It does n't make the search for the pursuit of the shells in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I want to invite you to close your eyes .
Imagine on the back to the door of <unk> home .
And I 'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door , the material that 's done .
Now we 're going to take a group of <unk> obese .
They 're used in a <unk> career , and they 're going into their door .
I need to look at this really .
They 're very strong , they 're sweating , they 're going to show a lot .
And they collide against the door of his house .
There are bicycles flying everywhere , the wheels who go on the side , the scene of the wheels who end up in <unk> places .
On the hallway , the hallway , or what there is the other side of the door , and look at the quality of the light , the light takes on the <unk> of <unk> .
It 's <unk> .
From his chair , about a brown horse .
It 's a horse that talks .
You can feel his blue coat by doing it in your nose .
You can smell the cookie cookie , and you 're going to go back to go back to the mouth .
You know , it 's on one side , and they go to their living room .
So , in the room , and they 're doing more of your imagination , imagine by conjunction with it .
It 's a little bit of clothes , dancing on his center of the center , singing `` <unk> , I 'm called <unk> Time . ''
Now let me ask the kitchen .
The ground has been recorded with a way of yellow bricks , and from the oven come into the oven , the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> and the Len of `` The <unk> of Oz '' , <unk> from the hands .
Well , you open your eyes .
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that is taking every spring in New York .
It 's called the <unk> `` <unk> of the United States . ''
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist , waiting , I guess that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk> .
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different habits of hygiene .
They were <unk> hundreds of random numbers , looking at one time .
We 're going to take the names of tens and tens of strangers .
It 's got entire poems .
It 's going to be able to see who I could memorize the order of a deck of the wall .
And I thought , `` This is amazing . ''
These people must be the phenomena of nature .
And I started talking to some of them .
This is a man named Ed County who had come from England and it has one of the best memories .
I said , `` Ed , when you realized that you were a wise ? ''
Ed said , `` I 'm not a wise .
Actually , I have a average memory .
All of those who are involved in this competition , they say they have normal memory .
`` We 've been trained to do these gamma acts of memory using the old American techniques , which was a few years ago in Greece , the same techniques that we used to put up with their speeches , and the academic academic academic were used to memorize them books . ''
And my reaction was , `` Wow . How is I never heard about this before ? ''
We were standing out of the classroom in the competition , and Ed , who is a wonderful English English , even though a little bit of <unk> , he said , `` Josh , you 're a American journalist .
You know , you know ? ''
And I said , `` What ? No , why ?
`` Because I 'd like to teach us to teach anthropology , and how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> living , in national television .
That 's going to the world that anyone can do it . ''
And I said , `` Well , I 'm not healed , but maybe you can teach me .
Or , you have to start by something right ? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
And I ended up over the next year , not just training my memory , but also <unk> , trying to understand how it works , why sometimes it does n't work and what can be its potential .
I met a lot of really interesting people .
This is a man named <unk> .
He 's <unk> , very likely to the worst memory in the world .
His memory was so bad that I did n't even remember that I had a problem of memory ; it 's impressive .
And it was incredibly tragic , but it was a window that would allow our memory to what our memory is , we are .
In the other end of the spectrum I met this man .
This is Kim <unk> . In him , it was based on the paper of <unk> Hoffman in the film `` Rain Man . ''
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Lake Lake City , he would use telephone phone ; it was spreading .
And when I go back , it 's a lot of treated about the writing memory makes something more than 2,000 years in Latin , in the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages .
And I learned a lot of really interesting things .
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time to have a time , and there was a time to have a little bit of a little bit of being trained , a sudden and Copernicus was n't a thing as a similar thing , as well .
A long time , people invest in their memory , to provide <unk> their minds .
These techniques have made possible in our modern world , but we also have changed .
We 've been completely culturally culturally devices , and I would say that we 've changed , too .
As well , we have no need to remember , sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it .
One of the last places in our planet where we still find people who are passionate about this idea of a Muslim memory , a disciplined and illustrations is this kind of memory .
It 's actually not so unique ; there 's because it 's because of the world .
I was fascinated , I wanted to know how these people do .
A few years ago , a group of researchers from London invited to a group of memory of memory , the lab .
They wanted to know , it 's going to be brains in a way , structural or different <unk> of the rest of us ?
The answer was , not .
Are it more intelligent than the rest of the rest ?
They gave them a battery of cognitive tests , and the answer was actually , not .
There was really a really interesting difference and meaningful difference between the brains of the memory of memory , and the subjects of control .
When they put them into a MRI machine , <unk> their brains as <unk> numbers , expensive and forms of snow . They found that in the base of memory , <unk> parts of the brain , different to others .
In fact , they were used , or it seemed to use , a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation .
Why ? Is there something we could learn about this ?
It 's going to be engaged as a armed career , where every year looks like someone with a new way of remembering more things , more quickly , and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day .
This is my friend Ben <unk> , three times .
In his desktop , in front of him , there 's 36 <unk> of <unk> .
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> .
I know .
And while there 's a great amount of ways to remember things in these skills , absolutely all the technical techniques that psychologists call <unk> <unk> .
It 's illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox `` <unk> . ''
That 's his name .
And then I ask you , `` Remember that there 's a `` <unk> . ''
And when I ask back later , and I ask you , `` Remember that word I told you a while ? ''
`` Remember what it was ? ''
The person who told him that his name is Baker is a little likely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is `` <unk> . ''
The same word , different capacity to remember -- that 's weird .
What happens here ?
Well , the name Baker , actually does n't mean anything for you .
And with all the other memories that dance for his head .
But the word , `` <unk> . ''
They use white hats .
They have flour .
It would be good when they go home to work .
You probably know some baker .
And when I put that word for the first time , we started to put <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some back time .
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this about a half years ago in Greece 's Greece .
It 's been known as the `` palace . ''
The story says this : There was a poet called <unk> that he was going to a quarter .
They had hired it as entertainment , because before , if I wanted to give a very good party , you did n't get a very good party , you 're going to kill a poet .
He stood up , <unk> his poem of memory , and it 's going to go , and as soon as soon as it was , the classroom is collapsed .
They killing everyone .
But not only killed all of them , it 's not just killed by the bodies , <unk> <unk> .
Nobody could say who was there , no one could remember where they were sitting there .
So they could n't get the bodies .
One tragedy behind the other .
<unk> , standing outside , the only survivor , in the middle of the rubble , closed the eyes and realized that with your mind of his mind , I could see where I had been sitting every invited .
I took the family of the hand , <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble .
What we 're going to get out in the moment is something that we all know more or less intuitively , and it 's no matter if we 're not good for remembering names or telephone numbers or instructions for word word for the word of our colleagues , we have visual memory and spatial space .
If you 're going to tell you that I 'm going to give me the first 10 words of the story that I 've just heard of <unk> , it 's very likely to be very difficult to do it .
But I 'm going to bet that if you 're going to tell you who I was sitting on the horse , brown in his lobby , would be capable of <unk> .
The idea of the palace , is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember , and the more crazy , crazy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago , the first treated of memory , in Latin .
And how does it work ?
So let 's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk , and they want to do it of memory , the same way I would have done if he was invited to <unk> , 2,000 years ago .
What you could do is to imagine that they 're in the door of your house .
And I came up to some sort of absolutely ridiculous , crazy and memorable and comforting to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition .
And then you can imagine entering your house , and I see the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Ed Ed .
And that 's going to tell you that they want to make his friend Ed <unk> .
And then you 'd look at cybercrime , to remind you this funny thing that you want to count .
And then they walked in the kitchen , and the fourth issue that they talked about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year , and they have some friends to help them remember .
So it 's like <unk> speakers , it 's not a word for word , which is going to confuse it , but typical for typical .
In fact the term `` typical , '' comes from the Greek `` <unk> , '' which means `` place . ''
It 's a little bit of when people thought about the tweets and the rhetoric with this kind of space .
The phrase `` First , '' it would be like the first place in his memory .
I saw that this was just fascinating , and I went back with it .
I went to some of these skills of memory , and I had the idea of writing something big about this video of competitive <unk> .
But there was a problem .
The problem was that a little bit of memory is a boring event .
In serious , it 's how to see a lot of people sitting sitting with tests , and I mean , the most exciting thing that happens is when someone else 's going on .
I 'm a journalist , and I need to be able to write about something .
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people , but I do n't have access .
I realized that if I was going to tell this story , I needed to tell this story .
So I started 15 or 20 minutes every morning , before I sit on the New York Times , just trying to remember something .
Perhaps a poem . Or the names of a old school community bought in a <unk> market .
And I found that this was <unk> fun .
I would never have expected it .
It was fun , because it was n't just to train memory .
What it is actually about doing is better more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images , cartoons , <unk> , <unk> and hopefully <unk> , in the eye of the mind .
I became pretty much with this .
This is me , using my standard level for the memory competition .
It 's a couple of <unk> and a little security goggles covered with tape , leaving two <unk> , because the river is the worst enemy of a memory .
And I ended up back to the same competition that had covered a year before , and I had the idea that I could put in , in a kind of <unk> experiment .
I thought that this could serve a whole thing for all my research .
The problem was that the experiment came out of control .
And I won the competition , something I did n't have to happen .
Of course , it 's cute power to hire speech , and numbers of telephone , and this is not the point .
These are just just tricks .
Because it 's based on very basic principles about how the brain works .
And it 's not necessary to put them to build <unk> of the memory or <unk> <unk> . To benefit with a little bit of what your mind works .
So , you often talk about people with a great memory , as if it was an awful deal like , but it 's not the case .
The great memories .
The most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
You know , <unk> when we focus deeply .
The palazzo of memory -- these memory techniques , are just shortcuts .
In fact , it 's not even shortcuts .
They work because they make them <unk> .
It 's going to be a profound kind of processing , a kind of a whole sense that most of it is not <unk> .
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts .
This is how things do .
And if there 's something I want to leave with you today , is what <unk> , the <unk> that I could n't even remember that I had a memory problem , I left me , which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories .
How much are we willing to lose what 's already our short existence of <unk> in the Hurtigruten or iPhone , not paying attention to the human being in front of us , who walks around our side , and you 're going to be so <unk> that we do n't even have to get it into process deep ?
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us .
But if you want to live a memorable life , you must be the kind of person who remembers remembering .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the architecture of architecture .
It 's a lot to cover in 18 minutes .
It 's a complex issue , so it would be just a complex place : New Jersey .
Because for 30 years ago , I 'm a couple years old , I was six years old and lived in my parents in a town named <unk> , and this was my child of a child .
On the corner , from my bedroom , I was the bathroom that shared with my sister .
And , between my bedroom and the bathroom , there was a balcony that I gave the room to be .
And there 's all the time looking at television , so every time I went from my room to the bathroom , all of me just see me , and every time I 'm going to get me back and go back on a towel , you all saw me .
And I was like this .
It was awkward , insecure and I hated it .
I hated that journey , I hated that balcony , I hated that room and that house .
That 's architecture .
Okay .
Those feelings , those emotions that I felt , that is the power of architecture , because architecture is not about mathematics , it 's not going to division of areas , but of those connections , emotional connections , that we feel in the places that deal with .
And it 's not a wonder that we feel like this way , because according to the U.S. Protection Agency , the American 90 percent of its time under the ceiling .
Or , 90 percent of the time we 're surrounded by architecture .
That 's a lot .
architecture determines us in ways that we do n't even notice .
That makes us a little naive and very , very predictable .
This means that when I 'm showing you a building like this , I know what they 're involved with , you think about `` power '' and `` stability '' and `` democracy . ''
And I know what they think about it , in a building , a half years ago by the Greeks .
This is a trick .
It 's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with ways that we build our buildings .
It 's a predictable emotional connection ; we 've used this trick for a long , long time .
We use it about 200 years to build banks .
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums .
And in the 20th century , we use it to build houses .
Look , these stable <unk> , solid , in front of the elements .
This is very , very useful because building stuff is terrifying .
It 's expensive , it takes a long time , and it 's very complicated .
The people who are building . The <unk> and governments , are always afraid to innovation , and they prefer to use ways that you 're going to work .
So we find them with buildings like this .
It 's a beautiful building .
It 's the <unk> Library that ended up in 2004 , and , you know , you have a dome ; it has this round thing , columns , red red , that you 're going to leave <unk> what they 're going to communicate with this building : the children , the values of property .
But it does n't have a lot to see with a library today .
That same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , it ended up another library , which looks like this .
It 's in Seattle .
This library shows how we use the media media .
It 's a new kind of public equipment for the city , a place to meet , read and share .
So , how it 's possible that in the same year , two buildings , two buildings , both such libraries , are so completely different ?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the principle of the pendulum .
On one side is innovation ; the architects that constantly drives new technologies , new <unk> , new solutions for life forms .
<unk> , we 'll be able to be able to be able to get out so much , that we 're completely completely .
All of the black , this is what we feel very well , but we 're dead because we do n't have another choice .
We need to go on the other hand and go back to connect with those <unk> symbols .
So we do it , and we 're all happy , but we feel like <unk> , so we started to experiment again , and we 're going to be able to experience the rest of back around , one and again . So , we 've done in the last 300 years , and of course , in the last 30 years .
Well , 30 years ago , we came out of the 1970s .
The architects were busy experimenting with the call `` <unk> . ''
It has to do with the concrete .
That you can guess .
<unk> little , in scale .
Very hard .
So , we 're approaching the '80s , and we started adding those symbols .
It 's going to be able to get the way back in the other direction .
We take those ways that we know and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and we added new materials .
I love .
We do n't give them <unk> .
We took <unk> , and we become a skyscrapers in skyscrapers , that you can be sampling of glass facts .
The forms are <unk> , they 're won with me and cut up .
<unk> became columns .
They grew up to the size of buildings .
A madness .
But they were the '80s , that was great .
We all went to the time in commercial centers , we move to the neighborhoods , and there , in the suburbs , we could create our own architectural anesthesia .
Those fantasy could be to the Mediterranean , the French , or the Italian .
You can be able to get a bit of bread .
This is what happens with <unk> .
This is what happens with the symbols .
They 're easy , because instead of creating new spaces , <unk> memories of other places .
I know very well , and all you know , that this is not the rest of us .
This is Ohio .
The architects are frustrated , and we started to make a little bit of the rest again on the other direction .
In the '80s and the early '90s , we started experimenting with the so-called <unk> .
We 're going to get the historical symbols ; now we have to have new techniques of design per computer , and we find us with new unification -- a few ways that are <unk> against other ways .
This is an academic and <unk> , and it 's <unk> ; you 're totally cut .
Normally , it 's <unk> again .
But then , something surprising .
In 1997 , the building this building .
It 's the vastness of Bilbao , from Frank Gehry .
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture .
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare times when critics , academic and public , they were completely according to a building .
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction .
The tourism tourism evolved in a half percent of the building .
So , suddenly , everyone wanted one of those buildings : Los Angeles , Seattle , Chicago , New York , Cleveland , <unk> .
Everybody wanted one , and Gehry was everywhere .
He was our first star architect .
But how it is possible that these forms , wild and radical , how could it be possible to become ubiquitous in the world ?
And it happened , because the media would be <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms and tourism and tourism .
We created an emotional response with these forms .
The same thing did the main mayors in the world .
So everyone believed that if they had these forms , they had culture and tourism .
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new country , in the beginning of the past new architects .
It 's going to surprise it , and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennials , actually started going through the entire architecture . The digital media started to rise the speed of information consumption .
Think , for example , how they consume architecture .
A thousand years ago , they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building .
The transportation closes : you can take a boat , a plane , you can be tourists .
So , the <unk> technology . You can see on the newspapers , in television , and at the end , all of us are photographers in architecture , and the building is beyond its physical location .
architecture is everywhere , right now , that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture .
Because architecture moves so fast .
It 's not a long time to think about a building .
It takes a long time to build a building , three or four years , and in that time , an architect can design two , eight , or 100 buildings , before I know if that I designed four years ago was a success or not .
Because there 's never been good feedback in architecture .
This is how we find out of buildings like this .
It was n't a <unk> movement , but 20 years .
For 20 years , we were building buildings like this because we had no idea of how much <unk> .
That 's never going to go back to happen , I think , because we 're in the threshold of the most revolution in architecture of the concrete invention , the steel or the elevator , and it 's the revolution of the media .
My theory is that when we apply it to the media media , it starts to give them faster and faster and faster , to be in both extreme extreme extreme right , and it was effectively the difference between innovation and symbol , between us , architects , and you , the public .
Now , we can do almost instant symbols , with emotional charge , of something completely new .
Let me teach you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently .
We went down to replace this building that was pulled out .
This is the center of a town named <unk> at Mission Island , in the state of New York .
It 's a vacation community .
But that meant that two years before I would end up the building , it was a part of the community , and as the drawings looked exactly the next product , not surprises .
And the building came to be part of the community , that first summer , when people started to come and share it in social media , the building stopped being just a building , it became a medium of communication , because these are n't just images of a building , because these are n't just images of a building , because these are n't just images of a
And as you use them to tell their story , they become part of the personal narrative , and that makes it <unk> with collective memory , and to charge these symbols , we learn .
I mean , we do n't need the Greeks to tell us how to think architecture .
We can tell us other what we think about architecture , because the digital media has not only changed the relationship between us , but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings .
Think about a second for a second .
If that building is built today , first of us were going to go to the Internet for `` new libraries . ''
I 'm going to be bombarded with examples of experimentation , innovation , what can be a library .
That 's strictly .
You know , they can take the <unk> mayor , to the people of <unk> , and tell you that there 's no only answer to what it can be a library today .
Let 's be part of this .
This abundance of solutions gives you to experience .
Everything is different now .
Now , architects are not those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complex drawings , and you 're not not a typical audience that does n't have to do anything before .
The architects can hear , and you 're not going to tell you for architecture .
That means that the pendulum of a style of a way to another , of a movement to another , is irrelevant .
In fact , we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems that face society .
This is the end of the history of architecture , and it means that the buildings of the morning are very different to the buildings today .
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the extent of a modern city .
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that , a stadium in Brooklyn , and not a bad imitation of the red brick in the ideas of what it must be a stadium .
This means that a few robots can be able to build our buildings , because we 're finally ready for the ways they 're going to produce .
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite .
This means that a parking garage in Miami , Florida , can also serve to do sports or for yoga , or even you can get married there at night .
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the New York City , and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause , it 's not a client alone .
It means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little <unk> pavilion , as <unk> and <unk> as the animals you 're going to look at .
Because it does n't matter if it 's a cow or a robot who is building our buildings .
It does n't matter how we build , what matters is what we build .
The architects you know how to make more ecological buildings , more intelligent and more like .
We 've been waiting for everyone else .
And finally , we 're not the opposite side .
Find an architect , <unk> and work together to make better buildings , better cities , for a better world , because there 's a lot of play .
The buildings not only reflect our society , but they give them way to the smallest spaces -- the local sensors , the households where we form our children , and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom .
Thank you very much .
This is my niece , <unk> .
It was just going to be a year and he started walking .
And it 's about that great , typical of the kids in a year , <unk> , as if your body was moving too fast for their legs .
It 's completely beautiful .
And one of the things that we like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror .
She really loves her reflex .
It 's laughing and <unk> , and it gives themselves the same big kisses and <unk> .
It 's beautiful .
Apparently , all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it , and I 'm going to think about : When I stopped doing this ?
How is we , of course , we 're not going to do with our appearance ?
Because , apparently , we do n't like .
Every month , 10,000 people are looking at Google , `` I 'm bad ? ''
This is <unk> , and it 's 13 years old .
And as any teenager , it just wants to be dear and fit .
It 's Sunday for night .
It 's preparing for the next week in school .
It 's got a little bit of fear , because , because his mom tells him everything that 's beautiful , every day in school , somebody says it 's bad .
Among his mom says , and what his friends , or colleagues of school says , you do n't know who believe .
So he makes a video of her , it 's made it on YouTube , and he 's asking others to leave a comment , `` I 'm pretty bad ? ''
Well , until now , <unk> has received more than 13 comments .
Some of these are such <unk> , which does n't even deserve to think about them .
We talk about a healthy teenager , normal and current , which gets these responses in one of the time of its more vulnerable vulnerable vulnerable .
And thousands of people are buying films like this , in its most teenagers trying to communicate this way .
But what is it going to do this ?
Well , the teenagers of today are almost never alone .
They 're under the pressure of being online and available all the time , talking , <unk> , saying , `` I like , <unk> , <unk> , this never ends up .
Never before we 've been so connected , very young , so young .
As a mother told me , `` It 's like there 's a party in his quarter every night . ''
There 's just no privacy .
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that , and that 's just like this .
This environment , of being always connected , it 's <unk> to our children to <unk> based on the number of `` I like , and the kinds of comments they get .
There 's no split between a life online and the real life .
It 's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what 's not .
And also , it 's very hard to know the difference between what it is authentic and what 's very incomplete .
What is the most famous thing in the life of somebody who is normal in a daily context ?
And where are they looking for the inspiration ?
Well , you can see the kind of images that are cover of the news 's news .
It 's going to get zero zero to <unk> our <unk> .
The technique of <unk> is now a routine .
And trends like , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
For those who <unk> , <unk> means <unk> .
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today .
It 's not very difficult to see what the young people .
But kids are not immune to this .
It 's like the emergency stars , and a <unk> singers .
But what is the problem with all this ?
Well , you know , we want our children to grow healthy and <unk> individuals .
But in a obsessed with the image , we 're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance , the price of all other aspects of their identity .
Things like their relations , the development of their physical capabilities , their studies and other ways they start suffering .
So six of 10 girls would prefer to do something because they think they do n't look enough enough .
These are not trivial activities .
They 're fundamental activities for its growth as human beings , and as opportunities to society and the field of labor development .
31 percent , almost one of every three teenagers are not interested in these kinds of class , <unk> to participate in the discussions of classroom because they do n't want to call the attention for its physical .
One of each five are not coming to classes at the time when they do n't feel comfortable about it .
And in the season of tests , if you do n't think you 're good enough , specifically if you do n't think you 're a thin enough , you get a lower note to the average of your companions who do n't care about it .
And this phenomenon is active in Finland , the United States and China .
And it was regardless of what they 're actually looking at these young people .
So , so , for course , we 're talking about as you can see , not how you 're really .
The low self-worth on your body is <unk> the academic performance .
And it 's also <unk> health .
The teenagers with time do less physical activity , they eat less fruits and vegetables , they 're involved in more diets , you do n't healthy you can take you to a food mess .
They have low self-worth .
They 're more easily <unk> for the people around and they 're in higher risk of depression .
And we think it 's all of this for what they make more <unk> decisions , as the consumption of alcohol and drugs , dramatic , neural surgery , <unk> , sex and no protection and no protection .
The pursuit of the perfect body is moving to the health system , and our government costs billions of dollars every year .
And we 're not controlling it .
Women who believe they 're overweight again , regardless of whether they have to do or do n't have higher rates of flying .
17 percent of women are not presented to an interview interview in a day that they do n't feel safe with the way you see .
Think about a moment where this is doing our economy .
If we could overcome this , what would that be that opportunity ?
We 're going to get this potential to each one of us .
But how do we do that ?
Well , I do n't just take it very far away .
Not enough .
If you really want to change things , you have to do something .
And we 've learned that there are three key forms . The first thing is that we have to make confidence in your own body .
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-worth .
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it .
The bad news is that most of these do n't work .
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs are okay , without to notice , make the situation .
So , we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children 's not only one positive impact , but also an durable impact .
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas . The first is the influence of the family , friends and relations .
So , these six ways are points to be critical for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-worth that work .
An education is fundamental , but you deal with this problem requires each one of us that we take the difference in the issue , and let 's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives , in our own lives .
It is challenging the current status of as women , and I talked about our circles .
It 's not good to count with the input of our politicians in <unk> , or the size of their breasts , or that the determination of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it 's not a great beauty .
We need to start judge people why they 're , not as you see .
We all can start doing it by making the responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks .
We can bring people into their effort and their actions and not in its appearance .
And let me ask him , when was the last time you get a mirror ?
In short , we have to work together as communities , like governments , and as businesses , to change our culture , so that our children will grow the whole person , measuring individuality , diversity , diversity .
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a pedestal .
To make a difference in the real world , let 's make them that they go on the big screen because we just create a different world .
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves , where the way they believe that you 're going to be able to be able to be able to be who they 're , or to achieve what they want in their lives .
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives .
Who are in mind ?
His wife ?
His sister ?
His daughter ?
His niece ? A friend ?
It could be just the woman who 's going to two seats of distance . What would it be for her if it was released from that voice to <unk> in its inside , which was glad by not having long legs , <unk> more <unk> , a more portable belly , small feet ?
What would it mean for it , if we 're going to do this , and we would do this , and we would do this , and we would do n't do it ?
Right now , the obsession of our culture , with the images that we 're going to do all .
But let 's get our children to the truth .
You know , the way you see is just one part of your identity , and that the truth is that we love them because of what they do , and by how they do , and as they do .
They <unk> the self-worth on our schools .
Let 's change each one of us , the way we talked about , and we compare to other people .
And we worked together as a community , from small groups to governments , so that the little <unk> of a year of age today , become in agents of safe change themselves .
Let 's do it .
The five of November 1990 , a gentleman named <unk> <unk> came into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> , the leader of the Indian Defense Council .
To <unk> the innocent , it was <unk> , but it was in front of other small charges , in company of others , started planning to plan attacks by 12 icons of New York , including tunnels , synagogues and the United Nations .
So , luckily , those plans are <unk> by a FBI informant .
Sadly , the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center , could n't avoid .
Later , it would be convicted of their participation on that attack .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in 1983 , being a Egyptian engineer , with an American mother , school school teacher , <unk> school , the two made all the possible for giving me a happy childhood .
Only when I was seven years old , our family started changing .
My father taught me a way of Islam , that very few , even most Muslims , they come to know .
For experience , I saw that when people take time to interact with , it 's not a lot to get the same things in life .
However , in all of religion , in all human group , there 's always a little fraction of people who are <unk> as <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use every possible media so that everyone lived like them .
A few months before the arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the last weekend of week , he and some friends , had been going to <unk> training at Long Island , to practice .
He told me that I would go with him the next day .
We got to <unk> <unk> that , without knowing our group , I was funded by the FBI .
When I was playing , my father helped me to hold the rifle on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim to a 30 feet .
That day , with the last bullet that I gave him to the little orange light on the target and , to surprise all of me , especially mine , all the target broke .
My uncle became the others and in Arabic , he said , `` <unk> <unk> . ''
As a parent , as a child .
In all , the comment was produced a lot of laughter , but just a few years later I realized what they seemed so funny .
You saw me , the same level of destruction that my father could do .
These people later would be willing to put a <unk> , you 're going to put it up with 700 kilos of explosives in the North tower of the World Trade Center , causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt to other 1,000 1,000 .
I admired those men .
He called him `` <unk> , '' which means uncle .
When I was 19 , I had moved 20 times . That instability during my childhood allowed me to do a lot of women .
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody was a moment of packing and go to another city .
As I was always my new face of the class , it was often <unk> .
It 's <unk> my identity to avoid to be the white , but it will be the new of the class , silent and <unk> , it was enough stressed .
So the most of the time the time I was in home to read books , watching TV or playing video games .
So for these reasons I did n't developed social skills , to say it was profitable . We were not prepared for the real world .
I was willing to judge people to judge people , with a base in arbitrary indicators , like his race or your religion .
So , how could I open your eyes ?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think , was during the presidential election of 2000 .
In a <unk> program in which I was born in the National Guard , in Philadelphia .
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence , as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my whole life , was something that I was feeling a lot of passion .
The members of this group came from all of the whole group .
One day , to the end of the convention , I found that one of the guys who we had done friendship , was Jewish .
He took several days out of the light of this detail , and I realized that there was no discrepancy between the two .
Never before I had had a Jewish friend , and frankly , I was very proud I was able to beat the barrier that all the life had been able to be able to believe it was <unk> .
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush , a success park .
I found me with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures , and that experience was fundamental in the development of my character .
All life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and , by extension , all the gay were bad influences .
By accident , I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there , in a show , and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics that I had seen in life .
He was developed a sense of the child , I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others , but it was n't easy to me to try to try to try to try to try to try to be treated .
For that feeling , I could take the stereotypes that I had been taught , with the experience of the interaction in real life .
I do n't know how to be the real thing , but I know what 's going to be a little bit beyond my control .
Then he came to the `` Lunch Show . ''
Every night , Jon Stewart brought me to be honest about my <unk> , and I 'm given me to see that race of people , religion or sexual orientation , you do n't have anything to see with character .
In a lot of ways he came up to me in a moment where I was desperately <unk> .
In times , the inspiration can come from the unexpected , and that a Jewish icon had had a better influence in my life that my own father , Brian , was n't in trouble .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think , and she told me something that I hold in my heart forever , while it 's alive .
She looked at me tired of somebody who has had enough with <unk> <unk> and said , `` I 'm tired of hate . ''
At that moment , I realized how much negative energy needs to keep all that hatred in your interior .
My real name is not <unk> <unk> .
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life .
So why did I decided to go out and put them into a risk .
Well , it 's simple .
I 've done it because I hope someone , some day , and I 'm going to take it to violence , can hear my story and understand that there 's a better way , which although I 'm going to get me to this violent ideology and <unk> , I did n't get to me .
Instead , I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and prejudice .
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives .
By the victims of terrorism to talk to , against those serious acts of the actions of my father .
With this one , I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race , that children do n't have to follow the paths of their parents .
I 'm not my father .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
At this moment , there 's a film that 's going to happen in your minds .
It 's an amazing thing .
It 's in 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now . But that 's just the beginning .
Your film has everything , taste and texture .
It feels your body , your pain , your pleasure , your pleasure .
It 's got emotions , anger and happiness .
It 's got memories , as moments of your childhood , which is going to be in front of your eyes .
And it 's constantly a voice of a voice , in your flow of conscious thought .
The heart of the film is you who experience everything in direct .
This film is your lack of consciousness , the subject of the experience of the mind and the world .
consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human .
Each of us is conscious .
We all have an internal film , you , you and you .
There 's nothing to know more directly .
At least , I know I have an awareness .
I do n't have anything that you 're conscious .
consciousness is also the reason to live .
If we were n't conscious , anything in our lives would be meaning or value .
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe .
Why are we conscious ?
Why do we have these internal films ?
Why do n't we only have the robots that we 're going to have to have to produce to produce the internal film ?
At this moment , nobody knows the answers to those questions .
So , to integrate awareness to science , you need some radical ideas .
Some people say it 's impossible to a science of consciousness .
Science , for nature , is objective .
consciousness , for nature , is subjective .
So you can never be an science of consciousness .
Because for almost all the entire 20th century , <unk> that vision .
The psychology was studying cognitive behavior , neuroscience was studying the asymmetric brain , but never no one mentioned consciousness .
Even 30 years ago , when TED started , there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness .
So , again , 20 years ago , everything started changing .
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger said , `` This is the moment for science <unk> consciousness . ''
And since then , there was a real explosion , a couple of the scientific work in consciousness .
And this work was fantastic . It was great .
But also has fundamental constraints to the moment .
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search search for some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness .
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago .
Now we understand a lot better , for example , the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking for faces or feeling pain or feeling happy .
But this is still a science of negativity .
It 's not a science of explanations .
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences , but we do n't know why .
I 'd like to explain to saying that this kind of work of neuroscience says some questions that we want to explain consciousness . The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain , and what it is responsive .
But in a sense , those are the easy problems .
No offense to wonder .
Actually , there 's no simple problems with consciousness .
Well , do n't address the real mystery mystery of this matter , why all the physical process in the brain has to be diagnosed with consciousness ?
Why is there a subjective film ?
At this moment , we ca n't understand .
And you can say , let 's take a few years to neuroscience .
It 's going to turn on another emerging phenomenon as the <unk> , such as a difference , and we 're going to find explanation .
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors , how they operate , how they work , how they play it , they 're engaged and stored in the living organisms , all of these are questions about the objective function .
That could apply the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a emergent phenomenon : how to walk out , how we speak , how we 're talking about , how we play chess ; they 're all questions about behavior .
But when it 's about consciousness , the questions about behavior are between easy problems .
But the difficult problem , is the question of why is that all behavior is with a subjective experience ?
And here is , the standard paradigm of the emergence , the standard paradigm of neuroscience , actually does n't have a lot to say .
I 'm a heart scientist .
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that would work . For a long time , I would call me the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in a human terms that would work .
But at the end , I came to the conclusion that that did n't work for a systematic reasons .
I think we 're going to tell us about this point .
We have a wonderful data chain , great , we 're used to do this -- the physics explain the chemistry , chemistry explains biology , biology explains part of the psychology .
But consciousness does n't seem to fit on this scheme .
On the one hand , it 's a fact that we 're conscious .
On the other , we do n't know how to make that idea to our scientific vision of the world .
I think consciousness , right now , it 's a kind of anomaly , something we need to integrate our vision of the world , but we do n't know how .
With an anomaly like this , you can need a radical ideas , I think we need ideas that we need to do , very crazy , before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way .
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas .
My friend Dan Dennett , which is here today , has one .
His crazy idea is that there 's no difficult problem of consciousness .
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion .
Actually , what we need to do , is to explain the objective functions , the behaviors of the brain , and so we tried everything that needs explanation .
Well , more power for him .
That 's the kind of kind of idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness by an awful lot , based on the brain .
At the same time , for me and for many other others , that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying .
But I 'm going in a different direction .
In the time , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be properly .
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
The physical sometimes take some aspect of the universe as the fundamental organism : the space , time and the mass .
It would be fundamental laws that rule it , as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics .
These laws and properties do n't explain in terms of more basic .
Instead , they think fundamental , and it 's building the world .
Sometimes , the list of the fundamental thing .
In the 19th century , Maxwell was discovered that you ca n't explain the bone phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts , space , time , mass laws , of Newton , and so he takes the basic laws of the gratification , and he carries the power laws like a fundamental concept that those laws reply .
I think that 's the situation we find with consciousness .
If you ca n't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas , space , time , mass , load , then by a matter of logic , you have to show you the list .
The most natural thing would be considered consciousness as something fundamental , a fundamental brick of nature .
This does n't mean that it 's not an object of science .
It 's because it opens the way to <unk> scientifically .
So what we need is studying the fundamental laws that govern consciousness , the laws that connect awareness with other fundamental concepts : space , time , the mass , the mass , physical processes .
The physicists sometimes say that we want to want fundamental laws that we could use them on a <unk> .
The situation of consciousness is something like this .
We want to find the fundamental laws that we could use them on a t-shirt .
We still do n't know what laws are , but that 's what we 're looking for .
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal .
Each system can have a degree of consciousness .
This vision sometimes is called <unk> : `` No , '' for all , <unk> , every system is conscious , not only humans , dogs , the mice , the mice , even the microbes of Rob Springs , the elementary particles .
There is some degree of consciousness .
The idea is not that the photons are smart or thinking .
It 's not that a photon can be full of anguish when they think , `` Oh , always traveling the speed of the light .
I can never slow down and smell the pink . ''
No , not .
But the thought is that perhaps the photons can have some element of raw feeling , subjective , some primitive precursor of consciousness .
This can sound a little bit crazy for you .
How does somebody think about something that crazy ?
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental .
If it 's fundamental , as the space , the time and the mass , it 's natural assume that can also be universal , the same than others .
It 's also worth to notice that even though the idea looks like <unk> , it 's much less for the people of different cultures , where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature .
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws that we 're going to do with the physical process , it 's <unk> consciousness with information .
There 's always information processing , there 's awareness .
It 's going to be complex , as a human being , complex awareness .
It 's simple awareness , simple awareness .
A very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist , <unk> <unk> , took this kind of theory , and I developed them with mathematical methods .
It 's got a mathematical measure of the creation of the information , which is called <unk> , which is the degree of information integrated in a system .
And they 're not supposed to do with consciousness .
So in a human brain , there 's an amazing degree of information integration , a high degree of <unk> , a lot of awareness .
In a mouse , there 's a half degree of information integration , the same pretty important degree of awareness .
But when you go to the worms , microbes , particles , the degree of <unk> .
The level of information is lower , but it 's not zero .
In the <unk> theory , there 's still a different awareness level of zero .
In fact , a fundamental law of consciousness : high degree of <unk> , high degree of consciousness .
Also , another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world .
The physical and philosophers are often observed that physics is quite abstract .
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations , but we do n't talk about the reality that underlies the reality underneath .
Like Stephen Hawking , `` Where is the fire of the equations ? ''
From the vision of the vision , the equations of physics can be able to be able to describe the flow of consciousness .
That 's what physicists do basically , describe the flow of consciousness .
According to this vision , consciousness is what you put fire in the equations .
In that vision , consciousness is n't found out of the physical world as a <unk> species .
It 's right there in the center .
This vision , I think , <unk> vision , has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature , and it can have social consequences and quite serious ethical .
Some of you can be <unk> .
I used to think that I did n't have to eat anything that I had awareness , then I had to be a vegetarian .
If you 're a <unk> and take that vision , you 're going to be a lot of hungry .
I think I think it 's good , this tends to transform your visions , whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral , not so much the fact of consciousness , but its importance and its complexity .
It 's also natural asking for consciousness in other systems , like computers .
What 's about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha on the movie `` <unk> '' ? ''
Is it conscious ?
According to the vision of <unk> information , she has a complicated information processing processing , so that the answer is yes , if it 's conscious .
If this is right , they 're very serious ethical problems about the ethics of smart computers and the ethics of <unk> .
And finally , you can ask for the awareness of the collective collective people , the planet .
Canada has your own awareness ?
Or to a more local level , a integrated group , like the audience in a TED Talk , in this moment , we have a collective awareness , an internal film for this complete group of the entire group of the entire group of the entire place ?
I do n't know the answer to that question , but I think that at least is a question that has to take seriously .
So , this means <unk> , it 's a radical vision , and I do n't know if it 's right .
And I 'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , that 's the second , which is universal .
The vision raises a lot of questions , a lot of challenges , like , how those little bits of thinking contribute the kind of complex awareness that we know and love .
If we can answer those questions , so I think we 're going through the right way to a theory of serious consciousness .
If not , it 's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy .
We ca n't wait at the night .
But I think we 're finally going to discover .
To understanding consciousness is the real key , I think , to understand the universe and to understand ourselves .
Maybe we just need the idea crazy idea .
Thank you .
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria .
He had a very normal profile , a under education profile .
I went to school , I 'm going to take me to me with my friends , I 'm going to get me with my friends under my sisters .
It was very normal .
And when I was 15 years old , a member of my community came up to my parents , because I wanted to <unk> for a prize of the community .
And my parents said , `` Well , that 's very beautiful , but there 's a logical problem .
She actually has n't done anything . ''
I went to school , I had good notes . After school , I had a under profile on my mother , and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> <unk> , '' and `` <unk> . ''
Yeah , I know . What contradiction .
But they were right .
I did n't do anything that was great at all .
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we take disability out of the equation .
A older years later , I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school , as only after about 20 minutes in the October 11 minutes , a kid took her hand and said , `` Hey , when you give your speech ? ''
And I said , `` What talk ? ''
Well , I had been talking about the law for a good good for about 20 minutes .
And he said , `` You know , you know , you know , your mind .
When people in the air chairs , they 're talking to <unk> things in school ? ''
`` Please , in the classroom . ''
And it was then when I realized , this child had had experiences with people like the inspiration objects .
And we 're not . And it 's not . And it 's not true of the kid , is to say , that 's true for many of us .
For us , people with disability is not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk> .
We 're not real people . We 're there to inspire .
And , in fact , I 'm on this stage , and I 'm going to do it in this wheelchair , and you 're probably waiting for you to inspire them . Right ?
Well , ladies and gentlemen , I 'm afraid to me <unk> .
I 'm not here for <unk> .
I 'm here to tell you that they 've been lied in relationship to disability .
Yeah , they 've been sold the lie that disability is a little bit of a little bit , a little bit of a little bit , <unk> .
It 's something bad and living with a disability makes you great .
It 's not a bad thing , and it does n't have to make you remarkable .
And in the last few years , we 've been able to spread even more this lie through social media .
It 's possible to have seen images like this : `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this one , `` His excuse is <unk> . ''
Or this one , `` Before I leave , <unk> ! ''
These are just a couple of examples , but there 's a great amount of them .
It can be that you 've seen one , of the child without my hands with a pencil for the mouth .
You can have seen a child who 's a child who 's a little bit of carbon .
And there 's a lot of these images , which are what we call porn inspiration .
And I use the term a group of people for the benefit of other group of people .
So , in this case , <unk> the disabled people in the benefit of people without disability .
The purpose of these images is to inspire them , so we can understand , so we can see them and think , `` Well , for very bad than my life , it could be worse .
I could be that person . ''
But if you are that person ?
I 've been lost the number of times that I 've been making young strangers to express that I 'm brave or a source of inspiration , and this would happen before my work had a public profile .
It was as if I 'm going to get me out for the morning and remembering my own name , and this is <unk> .
These images , these images would be <unk> people with disability in the benefit of people without disability .
They 're there for you , and think that things are not so bad for you , or to put their concerns in perspective .
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult .
Let 's get some things .
But the things that we do is not the things that you can think about .
It 's not relative to our bodies .
I use the term `` <unk> , '' deliberately , because I 'm going to tell me the social model of disability , which tells us that we 're more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics .
So I 've lived in this body for a long time .
I 'm very <unk> with him .
So the things I need to do , and I 've learned to take the best of their capacity , like you do , and that 's what happens with the kids of those photos too .
They 're not doing anything .
They 're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability .
So , it 's really just just <unk> in the way we do , to share those images ?
When people say , `` You 're a source of inspiration , '' which says it as a teenager .
And I know why it happens .
It 's because of the lie , because they 've been sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable .
And hopefully it does n't .
And I know what they 're thinking .
I 'm here <unk> the inspiration , and you think , `` For God , <unk> , are n't inspired by something ? ''
And actually , I know I 'm .
I think of other people with disability at all time .
However , I do n't learn that I 'm more lucky than them .
I think it 's about a great idea to use a great idea to use the things that I fall in , and I have a little trick of how to charge the battery 's battery on the battery 's battery .
Great .
We learn from the strength and resistance of others , not against our bodies and our diagnostics , but against a world that <unk> and <unk> .
I really believe that that lie that has been sold about disability .
It makes us hard life .
And that quote , `` The only disability in life is a bad attitude , '' the reason that that 's lying is , because of the social model of disability .
So a lot of smiles to get up to a piece of stairs , has no fact that it 's going to be a restaurant .
Never . You 're going to get it back to a television screen , I 'm not going to come down to a <unk> screen .
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore , and there 's a positive attitude to turn all those books to the pregnancy .
It 's just not going to happen .
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl , sitting in his bedroom looking at `` <unk> the <unk> <unk> , '' you do n't think of it to be in a chair .
I want to live in a world where we do n't have so low expectations of people with disability that we 're <unk> by the bed and remembering our names for the morning .
I want to live in a world where we value the standard accomplishment of people with disability , and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 grade in a high school school , not a little bit surprised that its new teacher is a wheelchair .
The disability does n't make us remarkable , but question what you believe to know about it .
Thank you .
What do you have to see reality reality and the professional football , with empathy ?
And what is the average speed of a nonprofit ?
Unfortunately , today 's just going to answer one of those questions , so , please do n't be <unk> .
When people think of reality reality , it thinks in <unk> <unk> , and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air , but reality reality is not science fiction .
The reality reality is something that 's going to happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it , and people need to know , because reality reality change our lives as the Internet and mobile phones .
So , how do we get to reality reality ?
The first step , it 's what I 've got in : The goggles Google Glass .
I 'm sure many people are familiar with them .
What you do n't know is that Google Glass are a device that allows you to see what I see .
They will allow you to experience what 's being a professional record in the field .
Right now , the only way to be in the field is that I 'm trying to try to <unk> .
I have to use words .
I have to create a framework that you want to do with your imagination .
We can use the Google Glass , under a hull , and knowing what it is running by the field of play to 100 miles per hour , the blood beat your ears .
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 kilos , <unk> , trying to <unk> everything .
I 've been there and I guarantee it 's not a nice thing .
So we 're going to get some videos to show you what 's the Google Glass under the hull , and give them an idea of that .
Unfortunately , it 's not images of the usual practices , because the idea of the dominant technology is a submarine coming down to the surface , but we do what we can .
So let 's look at a video .
Chris <unk> : Come on .
It 's horrible to be <unk> .
A little bit . It 's a little bit .
Are you ready ?
Go .
Chris <unk> : As you can see , it 's a <unk> of what 's going to be <unk> in the football field , from the perspective of <unk> .
You have to realize that we need people , the rest of the team .
We have a video of them , from the University of Washington .
<unk> of the field : <unk> <unk> .
Mission eight , Mission eight ! Go !
Chris <unk> : This is a little bit more about the feeling of being in the field , but it does n't have anything to do with being in the celebrity .
fans want that experience .
The fans want to be in the field , to be their favorite players , and I 've asked me on YouTube and Twitter , `` You can see from the angle of a <unk> field .
Or on a row ?
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass , how do we take it on the next level ?
We took it to that level by using something called Rift , which probably many people know .
The Rift <unk> has been described as the device of the <unk> virtual reality , and it 's not cheap .
And I 'm going to show you why , with this video .
Man : Oh , oh !
No , no ! I do n't want to go playing ! No !
Oh , my God ! Ah !
DU : That 's the experience of a man in a mountain , which is a <unk> .
What to be the experience of a fan when you 're going to put a video of <unk> <unk> across the line , <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before running and make a notation ? What is the experience of a fan .
When I can be <unk> running by the court , by putting the ball to the bottom of the network , or <unk> by doing a <unk> .
What would its experience when it comes from a mountain to more than 100 miles like a Olympic tower ?
Perhaps you 're going to be <unk> sales for adults .
But this is not really possible .
It 's just virtual reality , <unk> .
How do we get the reality reality , <unk> ?
It 's going to make the reality reality when the coaches , <unk> , and they were looking at the information of what people want to see and think , `` How do we use this to improve our equipment ?
How do we use it to win ? ''
Because they always use the technology to win .
They like to win . It gives them money .
So , I 've got a little bit about the technology in the Soviets .
In 1965 , the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> of the country to play faster .
They won the Super Bowl that year .
Other teams decided to bring them .
More people saw the game because it was more exciting , faster .
In 1994 , the Soviets put into the <unk> of the field of the field , and then in the goods of the laptops .
They were more likely , because it was faster , more fun .
In <unk> , imagine that they 're a player going back to his group and see his next step in front of you , in a plastic bombsight that they 're wearing . You 're not going to worry about to forget a move .
It 's because of the strategy .
They just go to the field and they react .
And they want them because if you do n't follow their instructions , they 're lost games , and they hate losing games .
If you lose games like a coach .
And they do n't want that .
But reality reality is not just a manual strategies .
The reality reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game .
How do you do it ?
Well , a very simple choice would be a camera on every corner of the stadium , having a view from the top of the people who are down .
You also get information from the sensors of the empires and the Phoenix , something that 's already working on .
And all of that information , you get your players to your players .
The good teams you know .
The bad ones will have information information .
So , this <unk> the good teams of the bad equipment .
So , your computer team will be as important as your mater , and the data analysis will stop being just to nerds .
It 's also for athletes . Who would have imagined ?
How would it be in the field ?
Imagine that 's the <unk> of the field .
They 're going to get the ball and <unk> .
They 're going to get a open receptor . Suddenly , a flashlight on the left part of your bombsight , you 're going to tell you that one defense behind you are going to <unk> . Normally , not really , but the system of <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to get to the area of protection .
Another Soviets , you know , there 's a open receptor .
They 're going to get the ball .
And the ball loses the trajectory .
You do n't know where to land . However , the receptor looks at its bombsight , an area of grass that 's stored and can modify the career .
He 's coming on , and you get the ball , it 's running and made .
The audience will go back and the fans have been following the way from every angle .
This is something to create a massive emotion .
I 'm going to make lots of people see it , because people want to live that experience .
The fans want to be in the field .
They want to be your favorite player .
The reality reality to be part of the sports because it 's too profitable to do it .
But what I ask you is , we want this to be the only use of reality reality ?
We 're going to use it just like bread and circus , like our usual entertainment ?
Because I think we can use it for something more .
I think we can use reality reality to encourage the empathy between human beings , to show someone how it is , literally , be in the place of another person .
We know what this technology is worth for <unk> .
It takes billions of revenues a year .
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> , how harmful is their actions from a victim ?
How much is this technology for a gay field in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world , how it 's been suffering ?
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> , trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk> ?
Ladies and gentlemen , reality reality is about .
The questions we do , the decisions we take and the challenges that we face , depend on , as much , of us .
Thank you .
So recently , I 'm going to beat me after 23 years of service in California .
The majority of those 23 years ago , I became the south extreme of the <unk> County in <unk> , which includes the Roman Roman bridge .
The bridge is a beautiful structure , known to the beautiful San Francisco of San Francisco , the Pacific Ocean , and its architectural style .
Unfortunately , it 's also a magnet for suicide , being one of the most likely places in the world .
The Roman Empire <unk> was open in Hyderabad .
Joseph kitten , an chief boss to build the bridge , he said , `` The bridge is virtually a test of suicide .
He died from the bridge is not practical or likely . ''
But from his openness , more than 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge .
Some of you believe that travel between the two towers , this bridge has an electrode , as a way of him , that every single one since he gets rid of your concerns and pain , and the waters they go under <unk> your soul .
But let me tell you what happens when the bridge is used to make suicide suicide .
After one free of four to five seconds , the body touches the water about 120 kilometers per hour .
The impact breaks out the bones , some of the other vital organ .
Most die in the impact .
The ones that do n't , they 're normally going to be <unk> on the water , and then they 're engaged .
I do n't think that you 're going to be able to put this of this method of suicide , you can realize the <unk> of the <unk> , which is going to play .
This is the wire .
Except about the two towers , there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge .
Here 's where most people have to be before we take life .
I can tell you for experience that once the person is in that edge , and in its more dark time , it 's very difficult to bring them back .
I took this picture last year , while this young lady talked to her life .
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the GreenLab .
When I started working on the bridge , we did n't have any formal training .
It 's going to stop the way through these calls .
This was not just a lot of service to those who <unk> suicide , but the officers also .
We 've got a long way from then .
Today , veterans and psychologists train the new officers .
This is Jason <unk> .
I met the 22 of July last year , to get a call of a suicide subject against a suicide message sitting in the middle of the center .
<unk> , and when I came , I looked at Jason Jason talking to Jason a officer of the Roman Empire <unk> .
Jason it had just 32 years old , and I 'd come up to here from New Jersey .
In fact , I 'd come up to two times before New Jersey to try against this bridge .
After close to a hour , talking to Jason Jason Jason Jason , I asked if we knew the story of the box of Pandora .
So , you know the Greek mythology , <unk> created the Earth with a box , and he said , `` Never open that box . ''
Well , a little bit , the curiosity could more than Pandora , and she opened the box .
She came out of it , and all kind of <unk> against the man .
The only good thing in the box was the hope .
So Jason Jason said , `` What happens if you open the box and no hope ? ''
He stopped <unk> , and it 's got to the right , and it was .
This kind of smart and intelligent , intelligent , intelligent , <unk> .
I talked to the parents of Jason that night , and I guess that when I was talking to them , it did n't seem to be ringing , because the next day , the rabbi 's rabbi called me to see how it was .
The parents of Jason Jason the parents .
It 's <unk> harm .
So let me ask you these questions : What do you do if a member of your family , a friend or somebody loved it was suicide ?
What would you say ?
So let 's tell you what to say ?
In my experience , it 's not just to speak , but you need to listen .
Let 's hear it to understand .
No <unk> , <unk> , or tell the person you know how it feels , because you probably do n't know .
It just is there , you can be the tipping point that you need .
If you think somebody 's suicide , you 're not afraid of <unk> and do the question .
So a way of asking the question is , `` Other people have thought about their life ; you 've had these thoughts ? ''
You know , <unk> the person in front of life and be the tipping point for them .
Other signs are looking for : despair , believe that things are terrible , and you 're never going to improve ; <unk> , believe that there 's nothing you can do about this -- political social isolation , and a lost of the interest in life .
He happened to me this talk about a couple of days , and I got a email of a lady and I 'd like to give you his card .
She lost his son in the 19 of January of this year , and I wrote this email just just a couple of days , and it 's with his permission and blessing that I read .
`` Hi , Kevin . I guess you 're at the TED conference .
It must be a whole experience to be there .
I 'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend .
I just wanted to leave you a note .
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to tell their friends , so on .
I 'm still pretty stressed , but it looked more times to realize that Mike wo n't go home .
Mike was driving to San Francisco to San Francisco to see his father in the 19 of January .
It never came there .
I called the police police , and it 's been taken out that night .
On the next morning , two officers came to my home , and I told me that the death of Mike was down on the bridge .
A witness , I had seen it from the bridge to the <unk> of the previous day .
Thank you very much to fight because of those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves .
Who has n't been before without having a real mental illness ?
It does n't have to be so easy to end with her .
My prayers are with you for your struggle .
The <unk> , the Empire <unk> is supposed to be a ticket through our beautiful bay , not a <unk> .
Good fortune this week , <unk> . ''
I ca n't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the way that his son took that day , and also the value to go back .
I 'd like to introduce you to a man that I 'm talking to me with hope and value .
On 2005 , 2005 , I said to a radio call for a suicide subject on the sidewalk of the bridge near the north tower .
I pulled my two-wheeler on the sidewalk and looked at this man , Kevin <unk> , standing on the sidewalk .
When I saw it , he crossed the railing , and he stopped in that little tube that 's going around the tower .
During the hour and the next half , I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair .
Kevin decided for her account that day back on that lane and give life another opportunity .
When Kevin became , <unk> .
`` This is a new beginning , a new life . ''
But I asked him , `` What was what did you go back and gave them to hope and your life else ? ''
And you know what told me ?
He said , `` I 've heard it .
I 'd never talk to you and just heard . ''
Little after that incident , I got a letter from the mother of Kevin , and I have this letter with me , and I 'd like to <unk> .
`` Dear Sir Sir <unk> , Nothing erase the events of the 11th of March , and you 're one of the reasons why Kevin keeps us .
I think Kevin was going for help .
It 's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it 's been properly <unk> .
I brought to Kevin when I was six months , completely unconscious of all those traits of <unk> traits , but , thanks to God , now we know .
Kevin is in order , as he says .
We give God for you .
<unk> debt with you , <unk> <unk> . ''
And at the end , she writes , `` <unk> . When I went to the San Francisco Hospital that night , you were <unk> as the patient .
`` Hey , I had to solve it ! ''
Nowadays , Kevin is a parent , and a active member of society .
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that its story inspire others .
suicide is not just something I 've found myself in the work .
It 's personal .
My grandfather was killed with poison .
That act , despite the end of their own pain , I was offering me the opportunity to know it .
This is what suicide does .
For most people who have suicide people , or those who consider suicide , you do n't think to hurt another person .
They just want your own pain .
In the general , this is just done just three ways : sleep , drugs or alcohol .
In my career , I said , and I 've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and called suicide suicide .
From those incidents that I 've been directly involved , I 've only lost two , but those two are too much .
You were Jason Jason .
The other one was a man who talked about an hour .
During that time , I 'm going to get my hand in three times .
In the end , I looked at me , and he said , `` Kevin , I feel , but I have to go . ''
And he jumped .
CC : absolutely horrible .
I want to tell you , yet , that most of the people that we 're going to be able to contact on that bridge , not <unk> .
In addition to , those few people have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it , that one percent or two percent , most of those people have said that the second thing that they 're going to be able to get a mistake and wanted to live .
I tell people , the bridge is not just connected to <unk> <unk> , but also people .
That connection , or a bridge that we do , is something that all and every one of us should be used to do .
suicide can prevent .
There 's help . There are hope .
Thank you very much .
The world makes you be what you 're not , but in your interior , you know what you 're , and a question you know , how do you get into that ?
I have to be something only in that sense , but I 'm not alone , for no way I 'm used .
When I became a model , I felt that I was finally done the dream that had been since a child .
My outside finally <unk> with my inner self , with my self .
So , I 'm going to go back to the most reasons that I 'm going to go back to , when I look at this picture , I think , <unk> , you 've got it .
But the last October , I found that , barely , I 'm starting .
We all set up our families , our religion , our society , our society , our own bodies .
Some of you have the value of free , to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who around us .
They are people who always challenge the status quo , which is considered accepted .
In my case , the last nine years , many of my friends , a lot of my friends , my agent , even my story .
I think this puzzle is called the revelation .
This is mine .
I 'm going to say , `` child , '' because of the appearance of my genitals .
I remember my five years in the Philippines , in my home , I 'd always put this t-shirt on the head .
And my mom asked me , `` Why do you always take that t-shirt on your head ? ''
I said , `` Mom , is my hair . I 'm a girl . ''
I knew how to <unk> .
The gender has always considered a sewers , but now we know that , really , it 's something more complex and mysterious .
Because of my success , I would never share my story , not because I think it would be what I 'm bad , but why the world is about those of us who want to be free .
Every day I appreciate is a woman .
I have a mom , Dad and a family who gave me like I 'm .
Many are not so fortunate .
There 's a long tradition in the Asian culture that understands the mystery of gender .
There 's a Buddhist god of compassion .
There 's a Hindu god , <unk> .
And when I was eight years old , I was in a party in the Philippines that floating these puzzles .
I was in front of the stage , and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me , and I remember that moment as a little bit about me -- this is the kind of woman that I wanted to be .
And when I was 15 years old , I met this woman named <unk> .
It 's the principal of a contest of beauty .
That night she asked me , `` Why do n't you have been involved in the beauty competition ? ''
He told me that if you 're going to put it out , it 's going to take it out of the cost of the highway and the pond , and that night , won in a bathroom suit , won in a <unk> , and he was a third finalist between 40 .
That moment changed my life .
Suddenly , I was inside the world of beauty .
Not a lot of people can say that his first work was the queen of beauty of <unk> women , but I can .
I also met the god of <unk> , especially when we traveled to remote provinces of the Philippines .
But more important that all of that , I met my best friends of that community .
In 2001 , my mom , who had moved to San Francisco , I called me and told me that passed my name of the green card I could go to live to the United States .
I was stored .
I said to my mother , `` Mommy , I 'm fun .
I 'm here with friends , I like to travel and be a queen of beauty . ''
But then , two weeks later , I called me and said , `` You know , if you ask the United States , you can change the name and the identity identity ? ''
It was all I needed to hear .
My mom suggested that I put two and my name .
She also came down to me when I was in Thailand in Thailand .
It 's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most <unk> surgeries , sophisticated and safe .
In the United States , it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender .
So , in 2001 , I went to San Francisco , and I remember looking at the driver 's license with the name of <unk> and the `` F . ''
It was a great moment .
For some people , their identity document means to drive , or power to get a drink , but for me , it was the license to live , to feel compassionate .
As soon , my fears looked like .
I felt that I could take my dream and move to New York , and it will be model .
Many are not so fortunate .
I think , in this lady of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A young woman in New York who lived in their truth , but that , <unk> , made her life .
For many of my community , that 's the reality that they live .
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population of the population .
Every 20 of November , we make a global waking on the <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm in this stage , because of a long story of people who are <unk> , and they put up to injustice .
So , these are Von Johnson and Sylvia <unk> .
Today , I 'm coming out of the closet .
I ca n't keep living , and just for me .
I want to do the best thing to help others live their truth without shame , nor fear .
I 'm here , <unk> , for one day , there 's no more <unk> than one day .
My real truth led me to accept what I 'm .
Do you do it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you , thank you , thank you . KT : <unk> , a quick question .
<unk> <unk> : Of course . You know , thank you first , thank you with all my loved .
To my support network , my parents especially , my family , which is very strong .
I remember all the time I 've been involved with young young women , which I 've got to have , and sometimes , when I was called , and they told me that his parents could n't accept it . I took the phone , called my mom and said , `` Mommy , you can call this woman ? ''
Sometimes it worked , others do n't . It 's just a gender identity , that 's what 's in the center of what we are , right ?
I mean , all of us have a gender to birth , and what I 'm trying to do is put on the table the subject that some times that was not block , and that should be a space that would give people to <unk> , and this is a conversation that we should be with parents , with colleagues .
It 's <unk> compared to the gay movement .
There 's still a lot of work for doing .
I should be understanding .
I should have space for curiosity and to do questions , and I hope you all are my allies .
KS : Thank you .
In a lot of and tribal societies , the parents are often known for their children , but I 'm one of the little parents who 's known for his daughter , and I 'm proud of it .
<unk> started his campaign for education to adjust their rights in the 2007 , and when you 're looking at their efforts in 2011 , to <unk> the American Medical Prize , became very famous , a very popular girl in his country .
Before that , it was my daughter , but I 'm now his father .
Ladies and gentlemen , if you take a look at the history of mankind , the history of women is the history of injustice , of inequality and exploitation .
You see , in the inner societies , right from the beginning , when I was born a child , his birth does n't mean .
It 's not welcome , nor for her father , nor her mother .
The neighborhood comes , day , his <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father .
And a mother gets a lot of a child .
When it gives birth to the first child , the first daughter , it gets sad .
When it gives birth to the second daughter , it 's <unk> , and , with the hope of a child , when he planted his third daughter , it feels guilty like a criminal .
Not only the mother suffers , but the daughter . The daughter was just born , when it grows , it 's also .
At the age of five years , when I should go to school , it 's left in home and school .
By the age of 12 years , it 's a good life .
You can have fun .
You can play with your friends on the street , and it can move around the streets like a butterfly .
But when it comes into adolescence , when it was 13 years old , it 's going to make it out of his house without a male .
It 's confined to the four walls of your house .
It 's not not a free person .
It becomes the honor of his father and their siblings and his family , and if you 're going to take the code of that honor of honor , could even kill .
And it 's interesting that this code code , it does n't just affect the life of a girl , also affect the life of the family members of the family .
So this brother , <unk> the joy of his life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of honor .
And there 's a more more more more more more norm of the societies that 's called it .
It 's not supposed to be very quiet , very humble and very <unk> .
It 's the criteria .
The model of a good girl must be <unk> .
It 's not supposed to be silent , and that 's taking the decisions of his father and his mother and the decisions of the elderly , even if you do n't want .
If a man who does n't like a man who does n't like it , or if a old man , has to accept it , because it does n't want to be <unk> .
If you 're very young , you have to accept it .
Otherwise , <unk> <unk> .
And what happens at the end ?
In words of a poet , `` The God , the <unk> , the <unk> , and then you get to more children and daughters . ''
And the irony of the situation is that this mother , <unk> the same lesson for his daughter and the same lesson of honor your children .
And this circle continues and continues .
It 's going to get siblings and sisters , when I was born , and for the first time , believe me , I do n't like the first born , to be honest , but when I was there and looked at her eyes , believe me , I felt very honored .
And so much before I was born , I thought in his name , and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan .
His name was <unk> <unk> , and I called my daughter for her .
But when I looked at , all of these were men , and I took my feather , and I took a line of my name , and I wrote , `` <unk> . ''
And when she grew up , when I had four years and a half years , the <unk> in my school .
You might say , why should I tell you about a little child in a school ?
Yeah , I have to say .
You can give them for granted in Canada , in the United States , in many countries developed , but in the poor countries , in the poor societies , in the tribal societies , is a great event for a child .
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name .
So a little bit like the school , it means that it 's in the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for its future life .
I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and I would be surprised , two weeks before , when you put the form of a Canadian visa , and I was in the relative part of the family , could n't remember the members of some of my sisters .
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written on any document .
That was the reason that value to my daughter .
What my father could n't give my sisters and their daughters , I thought I had to change .
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter .
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me .
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings .
And all of these values , I 've tried to be <unk> in its personality .
And this was n't just for her , just to <unk> .
I 've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids .
I used the education to get out .
I went to my daughters , taught the students , to forget the lesson of the d.school .
They taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk> .
It 's <unk> brothers and sisters , we were fighting for more rights for women , and we were trying to have more and more space for women in society .
But we find a new phenomenon .
It was lethal for human rights , and in particular , for women 's rights .
It was called <unk> .
That means a whole denial of participation of women 's participation in all the political and social activities .
Hundreds of schools have lost .
So girls are going to go to school .
Women are forced to use <unk> , and they 're going to go to the markets .
The musicians were <unk> , girls and singers killed .
<unk> million , but a few talked , and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for your rights .
It 's really scary .
At the 10 years , <unk> got up and got up for the right to education .
He wrote a day for the blog blog , he was offered her same for the New York Times , and I talked about every platform that could .
And his voice was the most powerful voice .
It 's <unk> as a <unk> around the world .
And that was the reason why the Taliban could n't tolerate his campaign , and the nine of 2012 of 2012 , was <unk> on the head .
It was a <unk> day for my family and for me .
The world became a great black hole .
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death , he 's going to tell my wife to my wife , `` I must blame him for what happened to my daughter , your daughter ? ''
And he said to me , `` Please , not <unk> .
It 's going to be the right cause .
You know , <unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace , and by the cause of education , and your daughter inspired by you and join him .
They both were on the right way and God to protect them . ''
So , these little words <unk> a lot for me , and I did n't go back again .
When <unk> was in the hospital , and he had severe pain pains , because its facial nerve was cut , I used to see a dark shadow that 's going on by the face of my wife .
But my daughter never complained about .
I used to tell us , `` I 'm okay with my smile , and with the <unk> in my face .
I 'm going to be good . Please do n't worry . ''
It was a comfort for us , and we were <unk> .
It 's <unk> brothers and sisters , we 've learned from her how to resist in the most difficult times , and I 'm happy to share with you that , despite being an icon for the rights of the children and women , is like any 16 year-old girl .
It was when it did n't just its task .
They fight with their siblings , and I 'm very happy for that .
And people ask me , `` What 's a special part of me , which has been so audacious to <unk> as brave , and <unk> and <unk> ? ''
I 'm not wondering what I did .
You know , I did n't .
I did n't cut your wings and that 's all .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
I went out of the brain for 18 years old , and , from that day , the science of the brain has become a personal passion .
I 'm engineering .
And I want to tell you that I 've recently brought me to the group of <unk> , and I 've had a <unk> to my office -- the <unk> of Google <unk> , but all the work that I 'm talking about today about the science of the brain , I did before join Google or outside of my work there .
Having said this , there 's a stigma when you 're going to put you to a brain operation .
They 're still just like smart or right ?
Would n't be like this , you can go back to be smart ?
Then of the individuality , I was missing a part of the brain , and I had to live with it .
It was n't the gray matter , but it was a dead of the center of the center that creates important hormones and neurotransmitters .
Immediately after the operation , I had to decide what a lot of you can take , more than a dozen chemicals every day , because if I did n't take anything , would die in a few hours .
Every day , for the last 18 years , I 've had to decide about the combinations and manufacturing of chemicals , and try to get them out , to go with life .
I 've been saved by a little bit .
But luckily , I have a soul soul , so I decided that I wanted to do to try to get the <unk> doses , because there 's really no one map that says to <unk> .
I started to try to try it with different <unk> , and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the doses of the <unk> , my sense of who was me , my way of thinking , my way to think , my behavior with others .
A particularly impressive case : for a few months , I tried doses and typical chemicals for a <unk> man , and I was surprised to see how my thoughts changed .
He was always angry , I thought all the time in sex , and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world , and -- of course , a lot of times in the past , I 've known several types of guys like , or perhaps some <unk> versions .
It turned out as a extreme .
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be arrogant .
In fact , I was trying to be trying to , a problem that I had to do in front , and it just did n't happen like this .
So , I could n't run it .
It changed my doses .
But , I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation of the men and about what they have to go through , so I 'm going to get better with the men .
What it was trying to do .
I 'm going to think about it almost always in images , and that became my key reference point , how to do those mental images that I use to create <unk> , my ideas , if you want to ?
This kind of thoughts is not new .
We 're going to be <unk> , Descartes and conservatives see the things in a similar way .
They thought that the images and the mental ideas were the same thing .
Today , you have to play this idea , and there are a lot of argument about how the mind works . For me , it 's simple : for most of us , the mental images are fundamental to the <unk> thought and support .
So , after several years , I 've got to find the point right , and I have already lots of great mental <unk> , really <unk> , very sophisticated and <unk> .
Now , I 'm working on how to take well quickly these mental images , from my mind to the computer screen .
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie film could be able to use their imagination just to run the world in front of it ?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head ?
There are amazing possibilities with this , as the way that the creative people can get to share the speed of the light .
And the truth is that , the only difficulty to do this is just increasing the resolution of our brain systems systems .
Let me show you why I think we 're pretty close to this with two recent experiments made by two groups in neuroscience .
They both use MRI technology , image with functional MRI , to represent the brain . Here you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his Harvard colleagues .
The spine on the left shows the brain of a person who looks like an image .
The middle of the middle shows the brain of the brain of that same individual as I imagined , looking at that same image .
The column on the right , I created the content of the central column of the left column , you see that the difference is almost dirty .
This is going to be taken into many different images with many different images , always with a similar result .
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine to see that same image is almost dirty .
Now , let me tell you another experiment . This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley , California .
They had to turn the waves of brain waves in visual fields .
We 're going to go back in this way .
In this experiment , I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos , while the brains would get their brains to create a great pool of the brain 's brain , to the video video video .
Then , I showed you a film with new images , new people , new animals , and as well , it 's a new scan .
The computer , using just the brain information of the <unk> , <unk> to show what the person was looking at .
On the right , you can see the signature of the computer , and on the left , the video I showed you .
So , this gave us <unk> .
We 're good close to it .
We just need to improve the resolution .
And now , remember that when you see a picture , and when you can imagine that same image , it 's believed in the brain the same map .
This was led to the systems of the greatest resolution of resolution available today , and their resolution is becoming a thousand times in the last years .
Now we need to rise the resolution to a thousand times more to get a deeper look .
How do we do it ?
There are a lot of techniques to do it .
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes .
I do n't give me for that .
Many are proposing new techniques of projection for images , even me , with the recent result of the MRI , first we have to ask the next thing , this technology will be the end of the road ?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets , but at this point , more <unk> , more <unk> , not for thousands as we need .
I propose this idea : instead of bigger magnets , make better magnets .
We can create a lot more complex structures with a slightly bit different , like doing a <unk> .
And why do this matter ?
In the last few years , a huge amount of effort in the MRI were to do really big , right ?
However , most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> and brilliant solutions , and <unk> , in the telegraph , and it 's going to come out of sheer radio radio in the systems systems .
Again , instead of a uniform field , we use magnetic patterns in the frequencies of incremental radio .
So , when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of different radio frequencies , we can increase the information the information that you can extract in a single sample .
In addition , we can then split in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need .
When we use the <unk> , we should be able to be able to measure the blood fluid fluid , but the <unk> and <unk> that I mentioned , and perhaps even <unk> neural activity . This is sleep .
We can be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media .
Can you imagine if we could go on top of the language and communicate directly through thinking ?
What would we be capable of ?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter ?
You thought the Internet is something big .
These are great questions .
It would be <unk> as a tool to define our skills and communication .
Certainly , this same tool could take the cure of Alzheimer 's and similar diseases .
We have a few more choices that we open this door .
In all ways , you take a year , it 's going to happen in five or 15 years ?
It 's hard to imagine it will take much more .
We need to learn how to give this step together .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about this night , and not just in a traditional sense , not just the gay closet .
I think we all have a lot .
His closet may be telling you to have any person for the first time I love it or tell someone who 's pregnant , or to tell someone who has cancer , or any other difficult conversation that you have to get into life .
All closet , it 's a difficult conversation , and even though our subjects can actually vary too much , the experience of I have lived and have been out of that closet .
It was afraid , and we do n't like it , and it must happen .
Many years ago , I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> , a restaurant in the city , and I was there , I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> : I do n't <unk> my armpits , quote the letters of <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm going to be out that for the <unk> of my short pants , and for me , I 'm going to ask me a little kid , I would tell me a little kid , `` Hey , you 're kid or girl ? ''
And there was a awkward silence on the table .
So I 'd put my jaw a little bit more , I would take my coffee with a drop of rage .
The father <unk> the newspaper , and the mother took a cold look at his son .
But I would n't say anything , and they 're going to be <unk> inside .
And I came to the point that every time I was going to be a child between three and 10 years , was ready to fight .
And that 's a terrible feeling .
So I promised me that the next time would say something .
I would have that hard conversation .
So after a few weeks ago , happened again .
`` Are you a kid or a girl ? ''
A family silence , but this time was <unk> , and I was about to come out of the women 's issues on the table , and I had a dating of Betty <unk> .
He 's dating .
Even one clip of the `` Vagina Monologues '' I would show .
So I got profound and I came down to my back and my back a little girl , with a pink dress , looking at what it 's not a challenge for a feminist record , just a child with a question , `` Are you kid or girl ? ''
So I took it back again , I took me from a lot about it , and I said , `` Hey , I know this is something like <unk> .
I have a short hair as a kid , and I saw a kid , and I 'm a girl , and you know , like you like to use a pink dress , and sometimes you like to use a comfortable shoe , and sometimes you like to use a comfortable shoe .
So well , I 'm more of the kind of girl 's kind . ''
And that girl looked at me , paying attention , and he said , `` My favorite arm is purple and has a fish .
Can you give you a <unk> , please ? ''
And that was all . It 's just like , `` Oh , you 're a girl .
What about the <unk> I asked ? ''
It was the hardest conversation that we 've ever had .
And why ? Because the child of the <unk> and me , both , we were looking at the one with the other .
So a lot of us , I 've lived in a lot in my life , and yes , my walls used to be a reception .
But in the dark , you ca n't know what color are the walls .
You just know how a thing is living in a closet .
It 's like my closet is not different to yours or yours or yours .
Well , I 'm going to give you 100 reasons of why I go out of my closet was more difficult to get out of your closet , but this is the issue : the difficult thing is not relative .
It 's hard .
Who can tell someone that you 're going to explain to somebody who have been stored in <unk> , is more difficult to tell you that it 's been fooled ?
Who can tell me that this story that I 'm more difficult to tell your son of five years that are going to be going to be going to ?
There 's no more difficult thing , there 's just the difficult thing .
We must be able to leave what we 're difficult to do for other people to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our homework and must just feel empathy because we all live something difficult .
In some point in our lives , we all live in work , and you can do security , or at least more security than the other side of the door .
But I 'm here to tell you , which does n't matter what they 're made your walls , a closet is not a place to live .
Thank you . Imagine yes .
I had a tail of horse , a dress and shoes .
It was n't the <unk> <unk> to fight against any child of four years to go back to coffee .
I was in the fear of the fear , <unk> in a corner of my dark closet , <unk> my gay grenade , and the moving only one muscle is the most scary thing that ever done .
My family , my friends , strangers that I 've spent my whole life trying to do , and now the world turned back to the purpose .
He was burning the pages of a script that we 've all been followed for so long , but if you do n't get that stops , they kill them .
One of my more memorable score was in my sister 's wedding wedding .
It was the first time that many people knew that it was gay , and when I do my friend of honor 's lady , in my black dress and email . walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents , people who knew I was a few years ago .
And after talking a moment , one of the women , I love , `` I love Nathan Hospital ! ''
And the battle of the gay story had started .
`` <unk> , once they were in the shelf ? ''
`` Well , yes , the truth is we have friends in San Francisco . ''
`` Well , we 've never gone there , but we 've heard it 's fabulous . ''
`` You know , you know , you know my <unk> <unk> ?
It 's very good and never talked about having girlfriend . ''
`` <unk> , what is your favorite television program ?
Our favorite program ?
And you know who I love ? Jack .
Jack is our favorite . ''
And then a woman , it 's wrong , but in waiting to show the support , to get me to know that I was on my hand , finally said to me , `` Well , my husband 's wearing pink , pink . ''
And I had an opportunity at that moment , as you have all the launchers .
You might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk> .
It 's not very difficult to find me , and you realize the fact that they were <unk> .
And what else is you to ask someone , but I 'm going to fight it ?
If you 're going to be authentic with somebody , you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you get .
It 's like the difficult conversations are still my strong point .
Tell anyone that I was left .
But I 'm getting better , and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk> .
Now , please look at this through the gay perspective , but they understand that what 's going to go out of any closet is essentially the same thing .
Number one : Be authentic .
You 're going to get it off . Be you .
That little child in the coffee did n't have fun , but I was ready for the battle .
If you want somebody to be true , others must know that we 're also missing .
Number two : Be right . It 's just <unk> .
If you know they 're gay , <unk> .
If they say their parents that maybe they could be gay , they will keep the hope that that could change .
Do n't give them a sense of hope .
And number three , and more important -- let 's make the complex .
You communicate their truth .
You know , they 're going to do that .
And some of you can go out , <unk> , <unk> for what they have done , but I never do it for what they 're .
And yes , maybe some of you feel disappointed , but that something in them , not in you .
Those are the expectations of them about what you are , but not their own .
That 's the story of them , but not of you .
The only story that matters is what you want to write .
So the next time you find in a dark closet , you have to know that we 've all been there before .
And it can be very alone , but they 're not .
Thank you , we 're going to fail .
Management , what is that ?
If you look at the story of how you 've seen the intelligence , a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> , which `` The machine can think it 's so interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim . ''
When <unk> <unk> wrote this , it was made it as a critical bias of computing as Alan Turing .
And so a few years ago , I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence .
Let 's take a step .
First start with a mental experiment .
Imagine that they 're from a alien race , that you do n't know anything about the biology of the Earth , nor from the Earth 's data and the intelligence of the Earth , but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth , and they have incredibly long , so you can look at the Earth for millions , even billions of years .
And you see a very strange effect .
Of course , we know that the reason we 're trying to save ourselves .
We 're trying to avoid an impact .
But if you 're from a alien race that does n't know anything about this , which has no concept about the intelligence of the Earth , you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how , until a certain time in time , the asteroids that we put on the surface of a planet today , they 're going to stop it .
And so I think this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence .
So in this program that took a variety of years ago , I studied a variety of issues through science , through various disciplines , that they 're doing , I think , to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence .
In cosmology , for example , there 's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be distributed to the development of intelligence , and , in particular , for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of future possible .
Finally , in a robotic movement , there 's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to adopt the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of making complex tasks .
And so , taking all these different issues and bring them together , I asked , since several years ago , there 's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we could extract from all these different topics ?
Is there just an equation for intelligence ?
And I think the answer is . And what you 're seeing is probably the most close equivalent to one E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen .
So what you 're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force , F , which acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action .
It takes it to maximize the future freedom of action , or keep the options open , with a force , with the diversity of possible future accessible , yes , until an impending time , <unk> .
In a few words , the intelligence does n't like to get stuck .
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and keep choices .
And so , having this equation , it 's natural asking : what can you do with this ?
How is it ?
Would you get the level of human intelligence ?
Would you use artificial intelligence ?
So I 'm going to show you a video that I think , showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation .
Narrator : <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more mess , or `` entropy '' , during your life , they should have a trend for the existence of intelligent beings like us .
But what happens if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence would have a deeper relationship ?
What happens if the intelligent behavior is not only with the production of entropy in the long-term entropy , but actually it comes directly from it ?
To find out , we 've developed a software engine called <unk> , designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system that you find inside .
Girl , <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence , playing games of human intelligence , and even to make money <unk> actions , everything without that he would have to do that .
Here are some examples of <unk> in action .
In the same way a single one of you can fall out , here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a cart .
This behavior is remarkable because we never gave them a goal .
He just decided for her to balance the wheel .
This skill skill is going to have applications for robotic robotics and human skills .
This capacity of use tools is going to have to have a smart manufacturing , and agriculture .
In addition , the same thing that some other animals can cooperate by pulling rid of a rope at the same time to liberate food , here we see that <unk> can do a version of the task of that task .
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields .
<unk> is widely applicable .
So for example , we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> itself , <unk> their potential to play .
So , here we see <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly constantly and keeps the net , well connected .
This same capacity of <unk> , also has applications in health care , energy and intelligence .
So , here we see <unk> to organize the routes of a factory fleet , discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand the world 's way to the Pacific .
In the same way , <unk> is widely applicable with problems in defense and <unk> and transportation .
And finally , here we look at <unk> spontaneously and run a strategy strategy , <unk> in a whole series of technical goods of actions , successfully increase assets under its exponentially management .
This ability of risk management is going to have huge applications in finance and safe .
Alex <unk> : So what you 've seen is that a variety of brands of smart cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools , walking upright and social cooperation , all of a single equation , which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action .
Now , here 's a profound irony .
So let 's go back at the beginning of the use of the robot , the play `` <unk> '' -- there was always the concept that if you were smart machines , there would be a sweet rebellion .
The machines go against us .
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades , we 've had all the concept of the sweet rebellion to the reverse .
It 's not that the machines are getting smart and then <unk> and try to go out of the world .
It 's all the way , that the drive of taking the control of all the future future is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence , that the general intelligence can actually rise directly to take control , rather than being backwards .
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target .
You often ask me , how do you look for goals , you 're going to get out of this kind of framework ?
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial roles or to help them understand human intelligence , is the next one : intelligence must be view as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions on its own future freedom .
Thank you very much .
We 're in a tipping point of the human history , something between the magnificence of the stars and losing the planet that we call home .
Although , in the last years , we 've engineered our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe .
The NASA mission mission 's mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting around other stars , what they think that Earth is only one between the billions of millions of planets in our galaxy .
Kepler is a space telescope that is the outer intensity of the stars when the planets are spending in front of them , and blocking a little bit of that light that gets us .
The data set up by Kepler show the sizes of the planets in the distance that there are between them and his mother star .
In a set , this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> as the planets of our solar system , and also the amount of light that they get from their own .
Again , this day , about if these planets that we find are a bold or not .
Unfortunately , as we 're finding this treasure treasure of worlds , our own planet is <unk> under the weight of mankind .
The year 2014 was the warmer recorded .
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us since millennia now , they 're disappearing in a question of decades .
And these environmental changes that we 've caused to the global scale , have gone quickly through our ability to disrupt their course .
But I 'm not not a scientist of the climate , no an astronomer .
It 's where I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars , with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet .
You could say that I 'm looking for aliens in the financial sector .
Now , as a very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe I can say that the more planets similar to the Earth , more enjoy our own planet .
Each of these new worlds tied into a comparison between the planet , and the planets that we know better : our solar system .
Take our neighbor , Mars .
Mars is small and <unk> , and in spite of being a little bit more from the Sun , it can be considered a habitable world , this by a mission mission .
In fact , it 's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past , and in part , it 's why we study it both to Mars .
Our <unk> like the `` <unk> '' between the surface of the origins of life as we know it .
The satellites that orbit it , like the <unk> mission , they take samples of the Mars atmosphere , and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose its Save .
The private companies now have not just a little bit of a short space flights , but also the ability to live on Mars .
But in spite of that all of these <unk> images , they remind us to the deserts of our planet , places that are linked to our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> , compared to Earth , Mars is a pretty awful place to live .
Let 's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that we still have to colonize , places in comparison with Mars .
Even in the lowest places and more length of the Earth , the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of kilometers away .
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets walking up with a great and sad shadow : the implications and the belief of some that Mars is going to be going to be able to save out of this <unk> <unk> of the single planet that we know that it 's really habitable .
So , I 'm just like this <unk> exploration , I 'm deep disagreement with this idea .
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars , but to say , Mars will be there to deny humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic , we 've been looking at that the fake of the Titanic would have place more late in the boats . Thank you .
But the goals for exploration <unk> and the preservation of Earth does n't be .
No , they 're actually faces of the same currency : the goal of understanding , preserve and improve life in the future .
The extreme environments in our world look like aliens .
They just get more close to home .
If we can understand how to create and keep in the ecological areas , in the hostile areas , maybe we could meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that .
I leave you with a mental experiment , the paradox of Fermi .
A lot of years ago , the western physicist I asked , which is the universe of a long time , and hopefully there were many planets in this universe , we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life to now .
Well , where are they ?
Well , a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when the civilizations become very advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars , lose the notion of the important thing that is protecting the origin of the planets that we 're going to do this development .
It 's arrogant to think that only the colonization of <unk> will save ourselves , but the planetary experience and exploration , you can work together .
If we really believe in our ability to apply the sustainable environments of Mars for the human presence , then we should be able to overcome the most easy task to preserve the Amazon on Earth .
Thank you .
A few years ago , <unk> my own house .
And as I was in the front porch looking at my pockets , I realized I did n't have the keys .
In fact , I could see the window that they were on the table of the dining table , where I had left .
So quickly tried to open all the other door and windows , and they were all closed .
I thought I 'm going to call a <unk> , at least I had my cellphone , but midnight , a <unk> could take a long time to get , and it was cold .
I could n't go back to my friend of Jeff to pass night because I had a early flight in Europe to the next morning , and <unk> from my passport and my bag .
It 's expensive , but sure , not more expensive than a half half night , so I thought , in spite of the circumstances , a good room .
I 'm a lot of career , and I know a little bit about how the brain works .
It takes cortisol that increases the heart rhythm , <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought .
And when I came to the <unk> counter at the airport , I realized I did n't have my passport .
Well , I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep .
And I started wondering , if there was something that I could do , systems that I could do , systems that I could put in the place , that I can avoid bad things .
Or at least , if you 're going to be bad things , which would be <unk> the likelihood that it 's a total catastrophe .
So I started thinking about that , but until a month after my thoughts did n't be <unk> .
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> , winner of the Nobel Prize , and a little embarrassed I talked about the window , and , that I had forgotten my passport , and Danny shared me that I had been practicing something called <unk> <unk> .
It 's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written about this few years before , known as the <unk> .
You all know what the <unk> is .
Every time there 's a mess , a team of experts , and it 's trying to figure out what was going wrong , yes ?
In the <unk> , as Danny explained , you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go out wrong , next , trying to figure out what can do to avoid that things happen or to minimize the damage .
So what I want to talk to you , is some things that we can do in the way of a <unk> .
Some of them are obvious , others are n't so obvious .
I 'm going to start with the obvious .
On the house , it 's <unk> a place for the things that you 're missing easily .
This sounds of common sense , and it is , but there 's a lot of science that 's going to be this thesis , based on how our spatial memory works .
There 's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , which has evolved over thousands of years , to make a deal of the location of the important things , where the good , where the fish are , which is turning the fish , where they have the fish .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that 's going to be <unk> in the fifth of London .
It 's the part of the brain that allows them to find their nuts .
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment , they cut the sense of <unk> , and then they could find their nuts .
They did n't use the smell , but the hippocampus , that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things .
But it 's really good for things that do n't move a lot , not so good for things that they move a lot .
This is the reason to lose your car keys , goggles and Wright .
So , in home , I would get a place for the keys , a <unk> next to the door , maybe a female dish .
For your passport , a particular taste .
For your reading goggles , a particular one .
If you get a place , and they 're <unk> with it , you 're going to be there when you look at it .
What about the trips ?
Take the phone , a picture of your credit cards , license , <unk> , <unk> by email for themselves to be in the cloud .
If these things are lost , or you know , this can facilitate the substitution .
These are some of the most obvious things .
Remember , when you 're under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
cortisol is toxic and <unk> the thought .
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that it 's not the best time , and you have to put the systems on its site .
And there 's perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision .
And at some time , we all will be in that situation , to have to take a very important decision about the future of our medical care , or a loved being , to help them with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
And I 'm talking about a very particular medical condition .
But this is <unk> as a <unk> , and in fact , it 's making the financial decisions and social decisions , any kind of decision that we have to take out of what they 're going to be made a rational evaluation of facts .
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says , `` I 've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little high . ''
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease , attack the heart , <unk> .
So you 're thinking that I have the high length , it 's not the best , then the doctor says , `` I 'd like to get a drug to help you reduce your cholesterol , a <unk> . ''
And maybe you 've already heard about the oven , and it knows that it 's one of the most attractive drugs in the world today , even it 's likely to know people who are doing .
So you think , `` Yes , <unk> <unk> ! ''
But there 's a question that 's got to do , then , a statistic that 's got to ask that most doctors do n't want to speak , and companies are even less .
It 's for <unk> , the number you need to try .
And what is this , the <unk> ?
It 's the number of people who have to take a drug , or to engage a surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person .
And should you think what kind of <unk> statistic is that ?
The number must be one .
My doctor did n't tell me something if it was not going to help me .
But actually , the medical practice does n't work like this .
And it 's not because of the doctor , and if it 's because of someone , it 's like me .
We have n't really understood the underlying mechanisms .
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs work only about 30 percent of people .
So the number you need to try to do the most widely <unk> , what do you think it is ?
How many people have to take it before to help a person ?
300 .
This is according to the research of the researchers who are telling <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> .
I just explore the numbers .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack , <unk> , or another <unk> event .
Now maybe you think , `` Well , one probability in 300 to get my cholesterol .
Why do n't , a doctor , you know , <unk> the recipe anyway . ''
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic , and it 's , `` <unk> of the side effects . '' Right ?
For this particular drug , the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients .
And those include terrible things : cultural pain , muscle pain , but now they think , `` five percent is not very likely to happen to me , still just take medicine . ''
But a moment .
remember that under stress do n't think about clarity .
So , think about how to do this with the time , so they do n't have to make the chain of reasoning in the act .
300 people take the drug , right ? A person has helped , five percent of the 300 have a side effects , that 's 15 people .
You have 15 times more likely to go out of <unk> by the drug that will help you the drug .
I do n't say they had to do or not take the <unk> .
I just say you must have this conversation with her doctor .
Human ethics takes , is part of the early consent .
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not .
Perhaps I 've been thinking that I 've been built this number in the way of the crash value , but actually this number you need to try it is pretty typical .
For the surgery that most of you do in the largest men of 50 , <unk> of prostate prostate cancer , the number you need to try to do is .
This is , you know , let 's die with a person who has helped .
And the side effects in that case , it 's produced in 50 percent of the patients .
Those include <unk> or dysfunction , <unk> , <unk> , fecal fecal .
And if you 're lucky , and it 's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two .
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before the questions that you can ask you to make the conversation forward .
You do n't have to make everything in the act .
And they also want to think about the quality of life .
Because you have a choice many times , you want a little more short life of pain , or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end ?
These are the things that they speak and think about now , with his family and their loved ones .
You can change it in the heat of the time , but at least you 're trained in this kind of thought .
So remember , our brain releases cortisol , and one of the things that 's going on at that moment is that they go to a lot of systems .
There 's a evolutionary reason for this .
We face the face with a predator , it 's not necessary the physical system , or the <unk> or the immune system , because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things , it 's not going to be fast . You could get the lunch of lions , so anything matters .
Unfortunately , one of the things that 's going through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought , like Danny <unk> and their colleagues have shown .
So we have to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations .
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we all are .
We 're all going to fail when .
The idea is to think about the future , how they could be those , to put the systems in the place that will help minimize the harm , or to avoid that bad things happen in the first place .
You know , <unk> at the night of snow , when I went back from my journey , my contractor brought me a combination of combination along the door , with a key way of the door in the same , a easy way to remember it .
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I did n't know , and lots of text messages I have n't read .
So I 'm not very organized , but I see the organization as a gradual process , and I 'm doing it .
Thank you very much .
Interpreter : <unk> , `` It 's my favorite music symbol .
It means it 's just playing gently .
If you 're playing a music instrument , and you see a `` <unk> '' , you need to play more gently .
Two .
Four .
This is my drawing of a tree tree , and it looks like it does n't matter how many thousands and thousands of them would be , never <unk> a complete silence .
That 's my current definition of silence : a very dark sound .
I 'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs , the <unk> , also a little bit of my own history .
The language of French signs came over in the 1970s , and with the time of time , it joined with local signs , and we developed the language that we know as <unk> .
So , it has a story about 200 years .
I was born , and I was taught that the sound was not a part of my life .
And I thought it was true .
However , I realize that it 's not true for anything .
The sound are a very important part of my life , actually , in my mind every day .
As a single person who 's living in a world of sound , it 's like I lived in a foreign country , looking at their rules , <unk> , behaviors and norms without <unk> .
So how do I understand the sound ?
Well , I see how people behave and respond to the sound .
People are like my speakers , and let the sound .
So I 'm going to get out that behavior .
At the same time , I 've learned that I can create sound , and I 've seen how people respond .
So , for example ...
`` No <unk> the door ! ''
`` Do n't do a lot of noise to eat the stock bag . ''
`` No <unk> , and when you 're eating , let 's make sure not <unk> in the dish . ''
It 's all I call it `` sound tag . ''
Perhaps I think about the <unk> tag of what the average person does .
I 'm a <unk> of the sounds .
And I 'm always waiting to be waiting for the sound , which is about coming next .
On there , this drawing .
<unk> , to decide .
<unk> , by going .
<unk> , to optimize .
You can see that <unk> has no notes on the lines .
That 's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle <unk> and spots .
In culture , the movement is equivalent to the sound .
This is the signal for `` <unk> . ''
A typical <unk> has five lines .
However , for me , to do the self with my thumb that does n't feel natural .
That 's why in my drawings just have four lines in paper .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for a artistic table there .
Before this time , I had worked like <unk> .
During this summer , I went to museums and spaces of different galleries , and as I went back to another , I realized that there was no visual art there .
At that moment , the sound was the trend , and that 's called me .
There was no visual art , everything was hearing .
Now the sound has come into my territory of art .
It 's going to have more of the art ?
I realized that it does n't have to be like this .
In fact , I know the sound .
I know it so well that it 's not just experienced through your ears .
I can feel a touch way , or experience visually , or even as an idea .
So I decided to hire the property of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice .
And all they had taught me to be taught to sound , I decided to leave and <unk> .
I started to create a new body of work .
And when I presented it to the artistic community , I was stuck with the amount of support and attention that I got .
I realized that the sound is like money , power , control : social currency .
In the bottom of my mind , I always felt that the sound was a bit of a logical person .
And the sound is so powerful that I could give me to me and my artistic work , or I could be empowering .
I chose to me .
There 's a massive culture around the language .
And just because I do n't use my literal voice to communicate , to the eyes of society is like if I did n't have a voice at all .
So , I have to work with people who can be just just like , and it will become my voice .
So I 'm able to be able to be relevant to the current society .
So in school , in the work and the institutions , work with many different types of <unk> .
And his voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me be known .
And their voices have value and weight .
Instead , to ask <unk> their voices , I 'm able to keep a temporary way of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate .
If I did n't continue with this practice , I feel that it could be <unk> in oblivion and not have any kind of social value .
So , with the sound like my new artistic medium , <unk> in the world of music .
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk> .
For example , a musical note ca n't capture and express completely on the paper .
And the same thing can be saying of a concept in <unk> .
The two are very space and highly <unk> , which means that subtle changes can affect all the way of the signals like the sound .
I 'd like to share you a metaphor of the piano , so they understand better how the <unk> works .
So , imagine a piano .
<unk> spreads in many different parameters .
If you 're stored a different shift for every finger as the piano , as the facial expression , the movement of the body , the speed of the hand , the way of your hand and so , while the piano , the English is a linear language , as if you 're going to be just a key language .
However , the <unk> is more like a chord , you need the 10 fingers to express a certain concept or idea in <unk> .
If only one key to change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
The same thing is happening with the music in terms of the tone , humiliated and volume .
In <unk> , to use these different parameters , you can express different ideas .
For example , the signal `` <unk> . ''
This is the signal `` <unk> . ''
I 'm seeing you .
<unk> .
Oh , <unk> .
Uh .
What are you looking at ?
Ah , enough .
So I started thinking , and if I look at the <unk> of the music lens ?
If I had to create a sign , and it would take it back and again , could be like a piece of visual music .
So for example , this is the sign of `` day , '' the Sun goes out and it gets up .
This is `` All day . ''
If you 're going to do it and <unk> the speed , it looks like a piece of music .
All day .
I feel that the same thing can say , `` All night . ''
`` All night . ''
This is all night , in this drawing .
And this led me to think about about three different kinds of night , `` Next , '' for night , '' at night .
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two .
This represents how the time does in <unk> and how the distance the body can express the changes in time .
For example , one <unk> . It 's a hand , two <unk> . It 's two hands , the present gets closer and in front of the body , the future is in front of the body and the past is on your back .
So , the first example is `` A long time ago . ''
Then , `` Come on . ''
`` It 's a big term with a specific rate of four times for them .
However , when I see the word `` common time , '' I think automatically in `` at the same time . ''
See <unk> : hand , E : On the left .
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest .
[ 2 : <unk> , <unk> .
Can I do it with me ?
All of the hands in high .
Now we 're going to do it so much on your head as a chest , something like the common time , or `` time . ''
Yeah , very well .
That means `` fall in the international system .
The international system , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world .
The second thing I 'd like to teach you is this . Please do me again .
And now this .
It means `` colonization . ''
Now , the third . Please ask me again .
And again .
It 's <unk> .
We 're going to do three together .
`` <unk> '' , `` colonization . ''
Good job .
Notice how the three signs are very similar . They all happen in your head and the chest , but they have very different meanings .
It 's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and prosperous , like the music .
However , today , we live in a very <unk> world .
And just because it does n't have sound , automatically has no social value .
We need to start to question what the social value defines the social value and allow the <unk> to take their own value , without sound .
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society .
And perhaps people understand that we do n't have to be deaf to learn <unk> , not to hear music .
The <unk> is a rich Declaration , and I 'd like to have the same experience .
I 'd like to be able to open your ears , open your eyes , to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language .
And you never know , you can fall down to fall out of us .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : Hey , that 's me .
In a child , my parents said , `` You can <unk> everything , but then you have to go out . ''
The freedom involves responsibility .
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places , where everything was possible .
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence , or a bubble bubble . I have to say , because the adults have been involved to protect us from the horrible truth .
When I get older , I found out that adults also <unk> and that they 're not very good to clean the other other .
The time happened , I 'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> of Hong Kong .
You do n't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach , <unk> with lots of garbage .
So as good citizens , the beaches , and not , it 's not drinking alcohol , and if it 's , I did n't .
It 's sad to say , but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic .
It 's sort of scary .
And in the last few decades , we 've been coming out with these great pumps and networks , to collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope , and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map .
But it lasts a <unk> and it 's very expensive , and it 's also very risky to use those huge boats .
So along with my students , with six to 15 years , we dream to invent a better way .
We 've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop .
We began to build this <unk> of work with <unk> , so that children very <unk> can be involved .
And I 'm going to tell you , the children who make electrical tools feel great and safe .
Not exactly .
Let 's go back to plastic .
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size that we find in the ocean , which is very small , because of its fragmentation .
That 's what we do .
I leave the imagination of my students .
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child , and trying to <unk> it in something that we hope to work .
We decided that instead of collecting plastic bits , just <unk> information .
By the use of a robot , we took a picture of this plastic -- the children are very excited with the robots .
Then we created so quickly what we call `` a prototype . ''
We 're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we finished before lunch .
And we turned into light bulbs and we put it into a floating robot that moves slowly by the water and by the plastic that we have there , and this is the image captured by the robot .
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor as the computer on board to process this image and measure the size of every particle , to get an open-source estimate of the amount of plastic in the water .
So we 're going to get this invention step in a website for inventors called `` <unk> '' , with the hope that someone will be more .
So the great thing in this project is that students saw a local problem , and you 're going to be able to do it immediately .
[ I can investigate my local problem , but my students in Hong Kong are very good .
You see the news , you get the Internet , and it 's <unk> with this image .
A child , maybe less than 10 years , they 'd say a oil spill , just using the hands , in <unk> , the largest center of the world in Bangladesh .
They were very surprised because this is the water that drink , it 's the water in the water that you valued , the water where they 're missing .
You can see the water is brown , the mud and the oil are also brown and when it 's all mixed , it 's very hard to see what 's on the water .
But there 's a simple technology called <unk> , which allows you to look at what 's in the water .
We built a first prototype of a button that can spread through all kinds of molecules that produce different <unk> , which can help identify what 's in the water .
So I 'd put this prototype with a sensor and we put it to Bangladesh .
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem , or to analyze a local problem , my students used its empathy and its sense of creativity to help each other children .
[ I can investigate a problem to do a second experiment , and I wanted to go a little further , and I wanted to go a little bit more far , maybe to address a more difficult problem , and also more close to me .
I 'm half Japanese and half French and perhaps remember , that in 2011 , there was a devastating earthquake in Japan .
It was so violent that I had a giant waves , called the globe , and those surrounding various cities in the coast of Japan .
More than 14,000 people died in a second .
It also gives the nuclear energy plant plant , a nuclear central to the water .
And today , according to the equivalent of 300 tons , you 're still dependent on the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean .
Today , all the Pacific Ocean has <unk> pollution .
If we go to the West coast , we can measure the ultraviolet coast everywhere .
But if you look at the map , it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast , and most of the time , it 's got safe , it 's blue .
Well , the reality is a little more complicated than that .
I 've got a year every year from the accident , and I made a independent way with other scientists , the land , the river , and this time we wanted to take the children .
Of course we did n't take them , the parents did n't help them .
But every night we come to the center of control -- here is the use of different masks .
I could seem that they did n't take the seriously work , but I know what they 're going to have to live with <unk> all his life .
And with them discussed the data , and we talked about what we were going to do after , the strategies , the <unk> , etc .
And to do this , we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear energy plant .
We created the map of the elevation , we 've created <unk> to represent real-time data , and <unk> water to simulate rain .
With this , we were able to notice that the radioactive powder was taken from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean .
It was a rough estimate .
But with this , we have a civil expedition , the closest to the nuclear central to the nuclear central .
We come up to a half kilometers of the nuclear central , and with the help of fishermen , we went collecting out of the sea bed with a <unk> of sediment as we invent and build .
Here we see a progression : we 've gone from a local problem to a remote problem , to a global problem .
And it 's been very exciting to work on these different scales , also with open-source technology and very simple .
But at the same time , it 's been more and more frustrating because we 've only been starting to measure the damage we 've done .
We do n't even start trying to solve the problems .
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent a better way of doing all these things .
So the classroom became a little little bit , so , we find an industrial installation in Hong Kong , and we become the most big space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact .
It 's in the center of Hong Kong , and it 's a place where we can work with wood , metal , chemistry , a little bit of biology , of fiber , basically , you can build almost everything there .
It 's also a place where adults and children can play together .
It 's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with adults , and where adults can be children again .
Students : acceleration !
<unk> <unk> : We asked things like : We can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy ?
For example .
Or , we can help the mobility of the age of advanced age , transforming their standard of standard wheels in new electrical vehicles ?
The plastic , oil and <unk> are terrible , but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies .
We ca n't afford to protect the kids of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions .
So , scientific citizens , creators , <unk> , we need to prepare the next generation for the environment and people , and so that I can actually do something about it .
Thank you .
Two twin domes , two cultures from radically opposite .
One is made of thousands of steel , the other one of a result of silk .
One of them is synthetic , the other organic .
One is defined about the environment , the other one believed .
One is designed by nature , the other one for her .
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the orangutan marble , saw a figure that struggle for being free .
It was just a single tool of Michelangelo .
But the living ones are not <unk> .
They grow .
And in the most small units of life , the cells , we have all the information that we had for every cell to work and to replicate .
The tools also have consequences .
At least since the Industrial Revolution , the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and production .
The assembly lines have applied a world in parts , <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> parts with different functions .
But you do n't find <unk> material in nature .
Think about the human skin , for example .
Our facial receptor are thin with <unk> pores .
The <unk> of the back are more thick with small pores .
You acts primarily as a filter , the other primarily like barrier , and yet , it 's the same skin : there 's no parts , there 's no <unk> .
It 's a system that drives its functionality through the variation of Kerala .
Here 's a <unk> screen that represents my vision of the divided , the double personality of every designer and an architect to work right now between the <unk> and the gene , between the machine and the organism , between the grid and the growth , between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin .
These two visions of the world , my left , and the right , analysis and synthesis , is shown on the two screens after me .
My job , in its simplest level , it tries to bring these two visions of the world , moving out of the assembly and go back to the growth .
You probably ask : Why ?
Why did n't it be possible for 10 or even five years ?
We live in a very special time in history , a little bit weird , where they have four disciplines that makes designers access to the tools that we never had access to before .
And in the intersection of these four fields , my team and I did .
Please know the minds and the hands of my students .
We 're using objects , products and tools and tools through scales , a robotic arm , like this robotic arm with a <unk> of 24 feet in diameter with a little bit of a very far way that some day was not very far distant buildings .
So , here we have <unk> the crabs , a rhetoric of the ancient Arab architecture , and it has created a screen where every single foreground is to model the way of light and the heat through him .
In our next project , we explore the ability to create a layer and a skirt . This was for a computer catalog of Paris with <unk> , <unk> . It 's like a second skin made of a single piece , <unk> in the abyss , flexible around the waist .
On the middle of <unk> 3D printing , we put up this layer and no biomaterials between the cells , I 'll show you more objects like that .
This hull by <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 .
This is the resolution of a human hair .
It 's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner .
That designers have access to this analytical of resolution and the synthetic instruments , it allows you to design products that are not just the way of our bodies , but also the benefit structure of our tissues .
We also designed a acoustic chair , a chair to the structural , comfortable , and also it absorbs sound .
The Carter professor , my collaborator , we went back to the nature to inspire it , and when you design this crease pattern , it becomes <unk> .
We 're going to get this surface of 44 different properties , which vary in solving , <unk> and color , <unk> the dots of pressure in the human body .
His surface , as in nature , resemble its functionality not by the addition of other material or another tree , but <unk> the same and causing property property .
But is the ideal nature ?
Is n't there parts in nature ?
I did n't go in a home Jewish home , but when it was young , my grandmother told me stories about the Hebrew Bible , and one of them got me , and it came up and came to define a lot of what me care .
As she says , `` On the third day of the hill , God will get the Earth to grow a tree <unk> tree . ''
For that first tree tree , there would be no difference between trunk , branches , leaves and sound .
All the tree was a fruit .
Instead , the land did grow trees with branches , crust , water and flowers .
The land created a world of parts .
I often ask me , `` What would the design if the objects were made out of one piece ?
Would you get a better state of creation ?
So we 're looking for the Swiss material , the kind of material of the tree <unk> , and we find it .
The second <unk> on the planet is called <unk> , and about 100 million tons of tons , they produce every year by organisms like shrimp , crabs , Bina and butterflies .
We thought that if we could tune out their properties , we could generate structures on one piece .
So that 's what we did .
We call it legal <unk> . We asked a lot of shrimp shrimp , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
We were able to get chemical concentrations , we 've been able to get a broad range of properties , from dark , hard and opaque , to the light , soft and transparent .
To print the structures on a big scale , it was built a system with multiple artworks of <unk> .
The robot could cause the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a whole material , 100 percent recyclable .
When the pieces are ready , it 's the dry leaves to find a natural way to contact with the air .
So why do we keep designing with plastic ?
The air bubbles that were a bit of the printing process , they were used to be able to have <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time a billion billion years ago , as we hear yesterday .
On the middle of our collaborators at Harvard and MIT , <unk> the bacteria designed of the atmosphere and turn it in sugar .
For the first time , we 've been able to create structures that make their transition transition , and if it gets more more , windows .
A tree <unk> .
It worked with a ancient material , one of the first forms of life on the planet , with plentiful water and with a little bit of synthetic biology , we 've transformed a whole structure made of the shrimp set of shrimp in an architecture that looks like a tree .
And here 's the best part : for the <unk> objects , and they 're built in the sea , <unk> the marine life , and put it on the ground , you will help grow a tree .
The way for our next exploration use using the same principles of design was the solar system .
We 're looking for the ability to create the ability to hold the life for <unk> trips .
To do that , we need to preserve bacteria and control its flow .
So , the periodic table , we did our own table of elements : new forms of life created <unk> , made in the form of <unk> and <unk> in biological form .
I like to think about the synthetic biology , as the liquid sky , only that instead of beautiful metals , it 's distributed to new biological capabilities in a very small channels .
This field is called <unk> .
We 're going to get our own 3D channels to control the flow of these water crops .
In our first piece of clothing , the two microorganisms .
The first is <unk> .
He lives in our oceans , and in the freshwater .
And the second , E. Wilson , the bacterium that fits in the human gut .
One becomes the light in sugar , the other increase sugar and produces useful biofuels for the environment .
But these two microorganisms do n't interact in nature .
In fact , never met .
They 're here , designed for the first time , to have a relationship on a piece of clothing .
Think about it as evolution , not for natural selection , but evolution for design .
To get these relations , we 've created a single channel that looks like the physical tract , which will help be spread these bacteria , and that they 're going to get their function on the way .
So we started to grow those channels in the human body , <unk> the properties of the material in the functionality of the functionality .
If we wanted more photosynthesis , <unk> more transparent channels .
So , this <unk> system , when you cut out of a extreme side , it 's 60 feet .
This is half of the length of a soccer field , and 10 times more than our wild gut .
And here it is , as you 're going to be in TED , our first wearable , <unk> channels with life within the clothing .
Thank you .
Mary Burroughs said , `` We 're creatures in fashion , only half is done . ''
What happens if design would be the other half ?
And if we could create structures that are living ?
And if we could create a personal <unk> that we 're going to get our skin , <unk> the broken tissue and make our bodies ?
Think about this as a form of edit biology .
I call this material ecology .
For it , you always have to come back to nature .
By now , you know that a 3D printer made in layers .
It also knows that nature does n't do this .
It grows . It 's <unk> .
This one of the worm worm , for example , creates a highly sophisticated architecture , a home inside of which it was <unk> .
The manufacturing manufacturing is not about this level of sophistication .
It makes it through the combination of two materials , but of two different materials .
One acts like structure , the other one is the glue or the matrix , adding those fibers between yes .
And this is about scales .
The silk worm does first turn into the environment , creates a structure of tension , and then it starts to get a little bit of compression .
The tension and the aurochs , the two of the life of life , it 's a single material .
In order to understand better how this complex process works , we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm , the line .
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of silk worm .
However , when you put the silk worm , it 's not within a flat patch , not within a box , we realized that I would have a flat bit and still <unk> .
So we started to design different environments , different scaffolding , and we 've discovered that the way , the composition of the sales , it 's called directly by the environment .
It 's often <unk> the diet of silk to death within their cocoons , its silk has gone and used in the textile industry .
We saw these tissue , we could start a way to the classic silk silk silk .
It 's <unk> , and we could create these things .
So we take this process to the architectural scale .
We had a <unk> robot doing a <unk> of silk , and we put it into our site .
We knew that the blind lines of silk and <unk> areas , so we use a <unk> diagram to reveal the distribution of the light and the heat in our structure .
So we created or <unk> , to block the rays of the light and the heat , stored the silk worms on the structure .
We were prepared to get the Walkman .
We asked you to have a lot of silk worms on a online net .
And after four weeks , they were prepared to meet us with us .
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the assumptions , and as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> eggs , and life starts again , like we , but a lot , much more short .
Rich Fuller said that the tension is the great integrity , and he was right .
When you have biological silk and <unk> silk silk , they give all this pavilion , their integrity .
And in a little bit of two or three weeks , they would have a half thousand silk lines .
In a curious symmetry , this is also the length of the silk route .
<unk> , after <unk> , produce 1.5 million eggs .
So this could be used for 250 kilos in the future .
So here 's the two visions of the world .
It 's a robotic arm through a robotic arm , the other hand full empty .
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us , to form a ecology of two materials , designers must bring these two visions of the world .
What it takes us back , of course , at the beginning .
Here 's a new era of design , a new era of creation , which leads us to a design design inspired by nature to an nature inspired by the design , which requires of us , for the first time , that we do charge of nature .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Hands up if you 've ever asked , `` What do you want to be more than you ? ''
If you had to remember what age were when they asked them for the first time ?
You can do it with the fingers .
Three . Five . Five . Five .
Now , raise your hand if the question , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
It 's caused some kind of anxiety .
Any anxiety .
I 'm somebody who could never respond to the question , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
The problem was n't that I did n't have any interest , but I had too too .
In school , I liked the English , <unk> and the art and the art sites , and also , he played the guitar in a third band called <unk> <unk> .
You may have heard about us .
And in general , I like to try and avoid anyway , for having a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field .
But in time , this feeling of boredom , this feeling , this is not a challenge , it comes to <unk> .
And I have to leave it .
But then I 'm going to tell me for another thing , a completely different thing , and I 'm going to be <unk> on it , and I 'm going to get me on it , and I 'm going to leave me on it , and I 'm going to leave me , `` Yes , I 've found my mind , '' and then again again this
And finally , I want to leave it .
But then I 'd like to discover something new and different , and I 'd like to go back on that .
This pattern led me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons .
The first was because I was n't sure how it was going to turn everything on a career .
I thought I had to pick one thing , which was all my other passions , and <unk> all my other passions .
Another reason I made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal .
I was worried that there was something bad about this , and something bad for me , and something bad for me .
I was worried to be afraid to the commitment , or to be <unk> , or <unk> or my own success .
If you can relate to my story , and these feelings , I 'd like to ask you something I 'd like to have to have to have to give you to ask me .
Ask themselves , where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or <unk> to do things .
I 'm going to tell you where they learned , and they learned about culture .
You ask first , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
When we have about five years .
And the truth is that nobody cares about that age .
It 's considered a naive question to make good responses in the kids like , `` Being an astronaut , '' or `` I 'm a dancer , '' or `` I want to be it . ''
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> .
This question makes us over and again as we grow in various different ways , <unk> , to school students , the question you 're going to pick in college .
And at some point , `` What do you want to be more ? ''
It 's going to be the cute exercise of before we take sleep .
Why ?
If well this question is inspired to kids to dream with what they could be , it 's not inspired to dream with everything that could be .
In fact , right , because when somebody asks you what you want to be , you ca n't respond to 20 different things , even adults , perhaps they laugh and say , `` Oh , what a cute thing , but you ca n't be <unk> and psychologist .
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Nadu and he 's a <unk> and <unk> .
And this Amy insisted , <unk> in <unk> , an entrepreneur and creative director .
But most kids do n't hear people like this .
All you hear is they 're going to have to choose .
But it 's more than that .
The notion of <unk> life is very likely in our culture .
It 's this idea of the fate , or the real Pole , the idea that every one of us has something to be done during its time on this land , and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate her life to it .
But if you 're somebody who 's not connected in this way ?
What happens if there are a lot of different issues that you get your curiosity and many different things that wants to do ?
There 's no place for someone as one in that framework .
And so you can feel just .
You can feel that it does n't have a target .
And I feel that there 's something wrong with one .
There 's nothing wrong in you .
You 're a <unk> .
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities .
It 's a breath for that .
I could help you if you divide it in three parts : multiple , potential and <unk> .
You can also use other terms of the same idea , as a scholar , <unk> .
During the time of the Renaissance , the ideal was who I was good <unk> in multiple disciplines .
You know , <unk> is talking to us as `` emergency . ''
You know , you know , you like you like it or <unk> one .
It seems like a little bit like a community to a community , we ca n't agree with one identity .
It 's easy to see the <unk> as the limitation , or let me be able to beat them .
But what I 've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas in my website , is that there 's massive strengths to be this way .
Here 's three superpowers .
You know , the synthesis of ideas .
I mean , the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection .
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> expressed their shared interests of data , visualization of data , travel , mathematics and design .
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and Rachel came up with this only idea for its combination of skills and experiences .
The innovation happens in intersections .
From there , the new ideas .
And the <unk> , with all their background , you can access a lot of these different dots of these dots .
The second superpower is learning learning .
When the <unk> we 're going to get into something , we 're going to do it .
We looked at everything we can have in our hands .
We 're used to be <unk> , for having been a lot of times in the past , and this means that we 're less afraid to try and get out of our comfort areas .
Lots of skills are <unk> to other disciplines , and we bring everything that we 've learned to every new area , so rarely we started from zero .
<unk> <unk> is a very long time , and independent writer .
As a little pianist , a amazing capacity to develop the muscle memory .
Now , she 's the fastest <unk> .
Before to become a writer , <unk> was a financial planner .
He had to learn the mechanical mechanics , when they were starting their practices , and this ability to write compelling tosses for the editors .
It 's because it 's a loss of time to go to what you get to you , even if the end of the leaves .
It 's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field , in a way that you could n't have to do it .
The third superpower , <unk> is the adaptability . That 's the ability to transform anything that you need in a given situation .
Kurt <unk> is sometimes director of videos , other , designer designer , sometimes a teacher , sometimes a teacher , and , sometimes , apparently , James Bond .
It 's valuable , because it makes a good job .
He 's even more valuable because it can take various roles , depending on the needs of their clients .
The <unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important skill for development , to thrive in the 21st century .
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that they 're the individuals and organizations that can <unk> the needs of the market , which actually thrive .
<unk> of ideas , quickly learning , and adaptability : three abilities where the <unk> are very upset , and three abilities that you could lose if they 're willing to reduce their goals .
As a society , we have a great interest to encourage the <unk> to them .
We have complex problems , we have complex problems right now , and we need creative creative thinkers to do with them .
Let 's say , in your heart , specialists .
They came out of the belly , knowing they wanted to be profitable .
Do n't worry , there 's no bad thing in you .
In fact , some of the best teams , a little bit of the best teams , and a <unk> <unk> .
The eye can dive into the depth and put in practice , and the <unk> offers a rocket of knowledge to the project .
It 's a beautiful relationship .
But we 're all going to design lives and careers that we 're connected to the way we 're connected .
And unfortunately , to the <unk> in a great part , they 're bringing them to just be more like their autonomous companions .
Once you said this , if there 's one thing that you 're going to take in this talk , I hope it 's this : <unk> with the inner wealth , whatever .
If you 're a heart of heart , then , <unk> all the media .
That 's where you give the best thing .
But for the <unk> in the room , including those who are just going to be one of them in the last 12 minutes , I 'm saying , <unk> with their many passions .
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> .
They 're going to say that intersections .
We 're going to be able to get our inner performance leads us to a more authentic life and happy life .
And perhaps the most important , <unk> , the world we need .
Thank you .
In the year , we know , a woman named <unk> took him to a <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and I could n't remember even the most basic details of his life .
His doctor was called <unk> .
I did n't know how to help <unk> , but <unk> for her until that , unfortunately , passed out in Calcutta .
After his death , <unk> did an autopsy , and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> , a kind of kind that never before before .
The most surprising thing .
If you 'd have been alive today , we could n't give her more aid that he gave him to be able to give it a few years ago .
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer 's .
And <unk> <unk> , the first patient to get a diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease .
Of course , medicine has a lot of medicine .
They have found antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections , a lot of treatments for the cancer , you have to make it for HIV and much more .
But a little bit of it has done on the treatment treatment treatment .
I 'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer 's about a decade .
So I think about this all the time .
Alzheimer 's now it 's going to spread to 40 million worldwide .
But in 2050 , it 's going to be 150 million than , by the way , to include many of you .
If they expect to live to 85 years or more , the ability to get Alzheimer 's being almost one of each two .
In other words , there 's the likelihood that they go to their years <unk> with Alzheimer 's or helping care of a friend or being willing to take care of Alzheimer 's .
It 's just only in the United States , Alzheimer 's <unk> costs $ 200,000 billion every year .
One of five dollars of medical care is spending in Alzheimer 's disease .
This is the most expensive disease , and their costs have a half of five times in 2050 , as the generation of the world 's generation .
You can surprise you , but Alzheimer 's is one of the biggest challenges and social challenges of our generation .
But it 's been a little bit of a little bit .
Today , one of the first 10 causes of death causes all the world , Alzheimer 's is the only one that you ca n't prevent , cure or even slow its development .
We understand less of the Alzheimer 's disease that of other diseases because we 've invested less time and money in the research of the same .
The U.S. government spending 10 times more year in the research of cancer , in spite of the fact that we 're more Alzheimer 's and cause a annual annual number of deaths like cancer .
The lack of resources is because the lack of consciousness : the lack of consciousness .
Because this is what people know , but everyone should be -- Alzheimer 's is a disease , and we can treat it .
For most of the last 10 years , everyone , even scientists , <unk> Alzheimer 's with aging .
We thought that we 're going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging .
But there 's just just looking at a picture of a brain with a healthy brain in comparison with a patient 's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
In addition to a severe loss of memory and mental skills , the damage of the brain caused by the brain , reduces the hope of life and it 's always fatal .
Remember , Dr. Alzheimer 's found tectonics and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century .
For almost a century , we did n't know a lot about this .
We know that they 're made of the molecules of proteins .
You can think of a molecule molecule , like a piece of paper , which is like a origami .
There are places on the paper that they 're full .
And when it turns out well , these <unk> dots end inside .
But sometimes things go wrong , and some different dots are going on the outside .
So , this makes the molecules of protein , and we 're making groups that can form great tectonics and <unk> .
That 's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer 's .
We 've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this dysfunction works .
There 's a lot of steps , and the identification of what 's going to block is complex , as a pump .
It was a wire could do anything .
You know , <unk> others can make the pump .
You have to find the right step , and then create a drug that makes it .
Until a little bit , in its most part , you 've got the cables and expected the best .
But now there 's a different group of people , doctors , biologists , geneticists , physical , physical engineers , engineers .
And together , we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process . Now , you 're testing a new kind of drugs that accidentally specifically this step to stop the disease .
Let me show you some of our last results .
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet .
Let 's look at some videos of what happened to the test of these drugs .
These are the healthy worms , and you can see that they 're moving with normal .
These worms , on the other hand , they have molecules of protein that you do each other inside of them , as in human beings .
And you can see that they 're clearly sick .
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in a early stage , then we see that they 're doing and live a regular life .
This is just a positive result , but the research like this shows that Alzheimer 's is a disease that we can understand and cure .
Then , I have a real hope of what can be done in the next 10 or 20 years .
But so you grow that hope , to beat Alzheimer 's , we need help .
It 's not about scientists like me , it 's about you .
We have to <unk> that Alzheimer 's is a disease , and that if we 're trying to do , we can <unk> .
In the case of other diseases , the patients and their families have a more research and logical pressure of governments , pharmaceutical industry , about scientists and legislators .
That was essential to move into the treatment of HIV to the late '80s .
We see that same unit to beat cancer .
But the patients of Alzheimer 's often ca n't talk about themselves .
And their families , the hidden victims , caregivers of their loved ones day and night , they 're often too excited to go out and advocate for change .
So , really depends on you .
Alzheimer 's not , in most cases of an genetic disease .
Everybody with a brain is the risk .
Nowadays , there are 40 million patients like <unk> , that you ca n't create the change they need for themselves .
They 're going to be talking about them , and they help demand a cure .
Thank you .
I published this article in the New York Times , in January of this year .
To fall inside somebody , do this .
The paper is about a psychological study , designed to create romantic love in the lab , and of my own experience to test myself in the same last summer .
So the procedure is pretty simple : Two strangers , <unk> for 36 questions , and then they both look at your eyes without talking about four minutes .
Here 's a couple of questions for example .
Number 12 : If you could raise tomorrow with a quality or skill , what would it be ?
Number 28 : When was the last time you 're going to be asked to another person ?
And just ?
They 're going through it , these are increasingly personal .
Number 30 : I really like to -- Tell your partner what you 're like him , or she -- I know very honest this time , and I gave things that you would n't tell someone you 've ever known .
When I came up with this study a few years ago , a little bit of the detail I was really called me , the piece of that two months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony .
So , it was pretty much about this process of making romantic love , but since then , I was also intrigued .
And when I had the time to test this study , with someone who I knew not particularly very well , I did n't expect to be .
However , we fell in love , and I thought that it was a good story , so I sent him to the Middle Way column a few months later .
That was published in January , and now it 's already August , so I guess some of you probably ask : keep together ?
And the reason I think it 's going to do this is because I 've done this question , and again in the last seven months .
And this question is just what I want to talk about today .
But let 's go back to the subject .
A week before I put this paper , I was very nervous .
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years , so , I had <unk> writing about my experience in the romantic love in my blog .
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred pages as a lot , and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably about thousands of sight .
And that took a good load of attention in a relatively new relationship .
But as he did , I had no idea .
The paper was published a Friday for night , and already the Saturday , this happened in the traffic of my blog .
And Sunday , I had been called the name of the Show , and the Good American <unk> .
In one month , the paper received more than eight million visits , and I was , to say something , little prepared for this kind of attention .
So one thing is to encourage the confidence writing with a bunch of their own experience , but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news , and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship .
And when people called it or write , what they did every day for weeks , always , did the same question : Do n't go together ?
In fact , when I was preparing this talk , I made a quick search search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase , `` Do n't go together ? ''
And several messages appeared immediately .
They were from students and journalists and young strangers like this .
I was fighting on the radio and they asked them .
And even , I gave a talk , and a woman I went down to the stage , `` Hey , where is your boyfriend ? ''
And I immediately put red .
I think this is part of the deal .
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper , you should expect people to sit comfortable with it .
But I was n't prepared for the ratio of the answer .
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life .
In fact , the New York Times published an impending article for Valentine 's experiences , which would give the experience of the readers at the study with different degrees of success .
So , my first drive to all this attention was to be very close to my own relationship .
I said , not every petition that we both did a public emergence together .
You 're going to get television interviews , and he hired the orders of photographs of us two .
I think I was afraid to become a fear of turning into the <unk> of the process of <unk> , a range for the one that I did n't feel at the surprise .
And I understand that people did n't want to know just if the study worked , they wanted to know if it really worked : I mean , if it was able to produce <unk> love , not just an adventure , but love , love <unk> .
But this was a question that I was not able to answer .
My relationship had just a few months ago , and I felt , especially , people asked the wrong question .
How do we know if we put them together , or not , and also saying ?
If the answer was not , do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting ?
Dr. Arthur Dennett wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997 , and there , the goal of the literature was n't producing romantic love .
Instead , I was looking for me , and I was looking to intervene between college students , using what charges it called <unk> personal personal staff , divided and rainbow .
It sounds romantic , right ?
But the study itself worked .
The participants were found more close to do it . A few years old studies also used the protocol <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers .
They have been used between members of the police and the community , and they have used between people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
The original version of the story , which I tried last summer , which combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact , was stored in this article , but unfortunately never published .
A few months ago , I was giving a talk at a little bit of liberal arts school , and then a student came up to me and said to me , and he said to me , and he said to me , and he did n't work .
He looked like it .
And I mean , you want to say that you 're going to tell you about the person with you ?
Well he made a break .
I think she just wants to be friends .
And I 've got better friends ?
Would you be able to get more better after trying to test the study ?
It was .
So , it worked , '' I said .
However , I do n't think that was the answer that he was looking for .
In fact , I do n't think it 's the answer that none of you are looking for when it 's about love .
I looked at the study for the first time when I was 29 , and I was a really difficult separation .
I had been that relationship since I had 20 , which was definitely all my adult life , and he was my first real love , and I had no idea of how or if I could live without him .
So I went back in science .
And I did everything that I could find on the science of romantic love , and I expected that this could be a certain way of <unk> .
I do n't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just did for the book that I was writing , in retrospective , seems really obvious .
I thought that if I was built with the knowledge of romantic love , I would never have to feel so bad and used to me .
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or another way .
I 'm more patient with love . I 'm more relaxed .
I have more trust to demand what I 'm looking for .
But I can also see me more clearly , and I can realize that what I 'm looking for is sometimes more than you can reasonably give me to me .
What I 'm looking for the love is a guarantee , not just to be taught today and being loved tomorrow , but I 'm going to continue to be taught by the person who I love .
It can be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together .
The story that the media was told about the 36 questions is that there can be a little bit of the fall to fall down .
There may be a way for some way to mitigate something about the risk of the risk , and this is a very attractive story , because you fall in it , you can feel beautifully , but it 's also scary .
But I think that when it 's about love , we 're very willing to accept the short version of history .
The version of the story that question : We still follow together ?
And its content with a answer of yes or not .
So more than a question , I would want to do more difficult questions , questions like , how do you decide who deserves your love and who does n't ?
How do you stay in love when things do it , and how do you know when to cut and sleep ?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably takes a relationship ? Or more , how you live with the question of your partner ?
I do n't know the answers to these questions , but I think they 're a good beginning to have a more primitive conversation about what it means to love somebody .
So , if you want to the short version of the history of my relationship , is this -- a year ago , a known one , and I have a designed designed to create romantic love , we fell in , still follow together , and I 'm very happy .
But immediately is not the same thing to stay in love .
<unk> is the easy part .
So at the end of my article , I wrote : The love did n't happen .
It 's <unk> because we took the choice to be .
And I 'm going to get a little bit to the read right now , not because it 's not true , but because at the time , I had n't considered everything that was supposed to be done .
I did n't think of a few times , we would have both that we would have both to take that decision , and how much times you have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always got to choose or not .
I want it to be enough to have done and told 36 questions , I have chosen to love somebody as generous , kind and fun and there 's expressed that choice in the largest newspaper of America .
But what I 've done , in change , is turning my relationship to the kind of myth that I do n't really believe .
And what I 'm looking for , and what I 'm going to spend my life looking for is that that myth is true .
I want the happy ending on the title of my paper , which is , by the way , the only part of the paper that I actually did n't wrote .
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love somebody , and the hope that he will also love , and it 's scary , but that 's the deal with the love .
Thank you .
I went raised for a little bit of a mountain , and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest .
So , the city of New York makes a time . Something that really struck me , but more details later .
So I was eight years old .
I took a box of wood , and I would have a dollar bill , a dollar bill , a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado .
And I thought that some strangers or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas , for example , how we eat spaghetti .
I had no idea .
In all ways , it 's kind of grace because here , 30 years later , and I still 'm doing boxes .
In a moment , I was in Hawaii -- I like to go back and do , and all of those weird things -- and I was doing a catalyst for my mother .
And I took a dictionary , and I took all the pages , and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> , I covered the morning , and a bee was stuck .
Well , my mother is afraid to the bees and it 's <unk> to them , so I add more <unk> in the canvas , thinking that I could <unk> .
Instead , it happened , in some way it looked like it 's going to be in size , as if it was going to be a magnifying glass .
So I did ? I built more boxes .
This time , I started adding electronic elements , frogs , weird bottles that I was finding by the street , everything I could find , because I was looking for all my life , trying to be able to tell stories about these objects .
So I started to draw around the objects , and I realized that my God can draw in space .
I can flow <unk> , drawing the same way it 's done about a <unk> of crime .
And I took the objects , and I created my own droughts of specimens .
First of the ones that you can have an idea .
Then I made some insects and strangers .
It was very much fun to draw on the lung layers .
And it was great , because I started to build it , and I was making something of money , to bring my girlfriend to dinner , for example , go to <unk> .
It was great , man .
At some time I had been interested in the human form , <unk> with a drawings of human beings in the layers .
It was great , except for one thing : I was killed .
I did n't know what to do , because I 'm going to kill me .
And I went to the bed every night thinking about it .
So I tried to use glass .
I started to draw on the glass layers , similar to the drawing in a window , then in another window , and I had all these windows together that we get a three-dimensional composition .
And this really worked , and so I could stop using it .
And so I did this for years , and my artwork <unk> with something very big , that I call `` Mmm . ''
So for the <unk> , I inspired me in a great measure as a <unk> , which is a painting in the Library of <unk> in Spain .
Do you know ?
Well , it 's a fantastic box .
They say it 's a little bit ahead .
Well , the `` Ma . ''
It 's about 11 kilos .
It 's five feet long .
It 's got <unk> , so they 're 10 meters of composition .
It 's a little bit weird .
Well , that 's the source of the blood .
On the left , it 's Jesus and <unk> .
There 's a cave where all of these creatures with the head of the local animals .
You 're going to go from the world 's world , to this kind of <unk> mesh , where they hide .
Here 's where the creatures with the head of animals are going to go back to <unk> , ready to kill them on the ocean .
The ocean is made of thousands of elements .
This is a bird , tied to a <unk> .
Billy Graham is in the sea ; the <unk> -- the <unk> platform of <unk> <unk> , there are all sorts of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean .
Anyway , also a kind of <unk> species .
It 's coming out of the ocean , and it turns out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out .
His hands are like <unk> , and it looks like this is what the Earth keeps and the cosmos in equilibrium .
So , it 's a aspect of the <unk> .
It 's a little bit .
That 's the hand in which it rotates .
And then , when you go to the other hand , it 's got a nose , like a peak of bird , and <unk> clouds of this nose .
It also has a tail of 15 feet long a tail of snake that unites him to the <unk> .
Anyway , his tail turn up to the <unk> of a volcano .
I do n't know why it happened .
Things they go , you know .
His tail ends up in a view of <unk> in 1986 .
Have you seen ?
They did in the 1970s , as if they were baseball cards .
It takes me to my time . This brings me to my last project .
I 'm in the middle of two projects : You call `` <unk> . ''
It 's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings .
Each one is a file of our culture , through media and material , and they 're infected , dictionaries or magazines .
But each one acts as a kind of file in a way of being human , and travel in groups of 20 , four or 12 to the time .
They 're like cells , they get together .
And you can walk between them . It 's taking me years .
Each one is basically a microscope , which weighs <unk> kilos with a human , trapped inside .
This is a little cave in the chest .
That 's the head ; it 's the chest , you can <unk> the input .
I 'm going to give you for the rest of the body : there 's a waterfall that 's coming out of the chest , and he covers the penis or <unk> , or whatever it has , a kind of thing <unk> .
It 's a quick view of these works because I ca n't get it for a long time .
We have layers , you can see .
This is a body game .
This has two head , and it 's communicating between the two .
There are a few pills that they come and go on the head of this strange statue .
There 's a little bit of a little scene that 's inside the mafia .
Can you see it ?
Anyway , this talk is about these boxes , like the boxes we live .
We 're in a box , the solar system is a box .
This brings me to my last box .
It 's a box of brick . It 's called <unk> <unk> .
Inside of this box , there is a physicist , a neuroscientist , a neuroscientist , a musician , a musician , a writer , a lawyer , a museum , an arm , a desktop arm , a desktop arm that reveals all the content we do in the world , and a garden .
We 're going to get the box and all the people in a few other as particles as particles .
And I think that 's the way to change the world .
So , when you realize that it 's and the box where you 're living .
And we got to realize that we 're all together in this , that this illusion that we 're different , these concepts of the countries , of the borders , of religion , does n't work .
We 're all very facts about the same matter and the same box .
And if we did n't start to exchange those things with them , and we 're all going to die very soon .
Thank you very much .
What do you do when it hurts your head ?
They take a little bit .
But for this pill , you have causes it against the pain , first happens by the stomach , the collisions and other organ .
I 'm going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> for any new drug of the body .
The disadvantage , yet , it 's that by <unk> any drug .
And this is a big problem , especially in patients with HIV .
When they take drugs , these serve the amount of virus in the blood , and increase the name of <unk> cells .
But they 're also known by their side side effects , in its most negative side , because in the time you take to the blood system , <unk> , and worse even for the time that we take to get your destination , which is where it 's more important , in the warehouse of HIV .
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes , the nervous system , the lungs , where the virus is a bit , and it 's not going to be easily , and it does n't go easily into the blood of the patients who are sending up to regular therapy with drugs .
However , after the treatment of treatment , the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells .
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life made by being done .
So one day , I sat down and I thought , `` Could we do the treatment right to the warehouse of the virus , without the risk of medicine . ''
As a scientific expert in lasers , the answer was in front of me : Amy , of course .
If you 're used in dentistry , for the care of wounds and surgery surgery , they can be used for any thing you can imagine , including the <unk> of drugs .
In fact , we 're using laser pulses to open or <unk> very small holes , that open and close to almost immediately immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs .
You ask , `` How is that possible ? ''
We sent a little laser and powerful beam on the $ cellular membrane as that these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug .
The laser travels on the cell , whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of Bosnia .
Before you even realize , the hole is <unk> immediately .
We 're now testing this technology in vitro or tectonics , but the goal is to take this technology to the human body , apply the human body .
How is that possible ? '' You can ask .
Well , the answer is : through a device of three head .
With the first head , which is our laser , we 're going to make a <unk> on the site of infection .
The second head , which is a camera , it 's going to go to the site of the infection .
Finally , the third head , a <unk> that follows the drug , it turns out directly on the site of infection , whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open .
Well , this does n't seem a lot of time .
But one day , if it has success , this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV 's body .
Yeah . A cure for HIV .
This is the dream of HIV -- in our case , an laser treatment .
Thank you .
In the last decade , I 've studied groups of armed weapons : organizations like terrorists , treated or alliances .
You know , <unk> what these groups do when they 're not shooting .
My goal is to understand the best to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to the violent confrontation .
I do work in the world of politics and the library .
To deal with these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course , because the war has changed .
I used to be a dispute between states .
No .
Now it 's a conflict between the states and actors .
For example , of the <unk> agreements with 1975 , and 2011 , <unk> were taken out between a state and an actor .
So we need to understand these groups ; we even have to engage or <unk> in any process of successful conflict .
But how do we do it ?
We need to know what drives these organizations .
We know very well the reasons why they fight , how do they do , but no one look what they do when they do n't fight .
The armed struggle and the political struggle is not connected .
Everything is part of the same organization .
We ca n't understand these groups , not much less <unk> , without a global vision .
The armed groups of today are complex organizations .
For example , the <unk> <unk> , known for their violent <unk> against Israel .
From its creation in the 1970s , <unk> also has set up a political party , a network of social services and a military device .
In the same way , the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian , known for their suicide attacks against Israel , also run the Gaza of Gaza since 2007 .
So these groups do more than just shooting .
They 're multitasking .
It would be a complex machinery of communication , radio stations , TV websites , and strategies in social networks .
And here you have this magazine magazine , and published in English and published .
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising of capital , but by profitable business , for example , construction companies .
These activities are key .
They allow these groups to increase their strength , increased their funding , to make better help and build their brand .
The armed groups also do something more : create more strong with its population investing in social services .
They build schools , running hospitals , they put it into a professional formation of professional formation .
<unk> offers all these services and more .
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population to make something that the state does n't give , security and protection .
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan , or even the principle of the rise of Mal , it can be able to be able to compare the efforts of these groups for security .
Unfortunately , in these cases , security has a <unk> price for the population .
But , in general , provide social services , it means to fill a vacuum , a <unk> gap by the government , and they allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power .
So for example , the victory of 2006 in 2006 of Palestinian cooks ca n't be able to be able to recognize the social work of the group .
It 's a really complex stage , even in the West , when we looked at the armed groups , we just think about the violent side .
But that 's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups , the strategy or the long-term vision .
These groups are hybrids .
They 're going to take up because we 're stored in the government , and it 's also like armed groups , and politicians , engage in the violent struggle and give governance .
And the more complex and sophisticated , these organizations are these organizations , less can <unk> as something opposite .
How do we call a group like <unk> ?
It 's a part of a territory , they run all their functions , they get the garbage , they 're running the ground system .
Is it a state ? It 's a <unk> group ?
Or it 's another thing , something new and different .
And what is there ?
The lines are <unk> .
We live in a world of states , of nations , and hybrids , and the more weak are the states , like in the Middle East , more come and put that gap , the government actors .
This is important for governments , because to trick these groups , you have to invest more in military tools .
It 's going to take that vacuum vacuum in the center of any sustainable approach .
This is very important to set up and raising peace .
If we understand the best to the armed groups , we 're going to understand better what incentives to provide the transition of violence to violence .
In this new dispute between states and actors , the military power can make some battles , but we 're not going to be peace or stability .
To get these goals , we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum vacuum , to fill that vacuum vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle .
Thank you .
I 'm a failure as a woman .
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> , but I 'm afraid to accept the label of `` feminist '' would be unfair for the feminist .
I 'm a feminist , but pretty bad .
And so I 'm going to tell me as a bad feminist .
Or , at least , I wrote an article , and a book called `` The bad feminist , '' and then in the interviews , people started to call me <unk> <unk> .
So , what he started as a personal joke meant to myself and a crazy chair , has become something bigger .
Let me give you a step back .
When it was young , especially in my youth and the 20 years , I had strange ideas about the feminist , these <unk> women , especially with the men , and they hate sex . As if that was something bad .
Nowadays , I see how women are treated in the world and anger , particularly , it seems a perfectly reasonable response .
But in that time , I was worried about the tone that I was using people to see it could be a feminist .
It 's going to be <unk> as a feminist , a <unk> word and nasty .
It was <unk> as a woman who does n't follow the rules , which is going to be too much , with high self-worth , and you 're going to believe that it 's equal to a man .
Nobody wants to be that young woman , until you realize that it 's actually that woman and ca n't imagine being another person .
With time , as I went growing , I started to accept that I 'm , in fact , a feminist , and also , proud of it .
For me , certain claims are <unk> : women are equal to men .
You know , they 're going to get the same to the same work .
We have right to travel around the world as <unk> , free or violence .
We have right to use it very easy and accessible control and services .
We 've got the right to decide about our bodies , without need to be able to be able to capture , or doctrines .
We have the right to respect .
There 's more .
When you talk about the needs of women , you have to have our other identities .
We 're not only women .
We 're people with a different body , gender expression , religion and sexuality , social condition , skills and much more .
We need to have these differences and how we affect it , the same way that matters what we have in common .
Without this kind of inclusion , our feminism is not anything .
For me , these truths are obvious , but to be clear : I 'm a mess .
I 'm full of contradictions .
There 's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist .
I have another confession .
When I 'm going to try to work , I hear music , <unk> <unk> .
Although the lyrics closed women and cool me , the classic `` <unk> <unk> . ''
`` Well , I 'm going to do with your free t-shirt .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> until you get the shell ! ''
Think about it .
<unk> poetry , right ?
I 'm completely impressed by my musical taste .
I think very firmly in the work of the man , which is all I do n't want to do , including -- every home job , but also killing insects , the chain of garbage , the <unk> of the grass and the nest of <unk> .
I do n't want to have anything to do with that .
The pink is my favorite color .
I get out of the fashion magazines and things like it .
I can see `` The <unk> , '' and the blindfold , and I 've got <unk> , and I 've got some of the stories of <unk> who are actually done .
Some of my crimes are more <unk> .
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband , it 's his choice , and I 'm not to judge me .
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children , I accept that choice , also .
The problem is not that it becomes much vulnerable through this same choice , the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are vulnerable vulnerable when they choose .
We do this problem .
You know , they 're going to be ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women , and the workers , gay workers , in favor of white women and high .
Listen , if that 's a very bad feminist feminist .
It 's also happening , as a feminist , I feel a lot of pressure .
We 've got this trend to put stuck in a pedestal .
We hope it would be <unk> .
When we 're going to be <unk> , we rented them with a lot of taste , where we put them .
So , as I said , I 'm a disaster ; I 've already consider me about that pedestal before I try to put out there .
Many women , particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector , they 're afraid of being labeled as feminist .
They 're afraid of standing and say , `` Yes , I 'm a feminist , '' because , `` Yes , I 'm a feminist , '' because of what that tag means , because we could n't be able to be able to be able to be able to get a little realistic expectations .
Let 's take for an example to <unk> , or like I call it , the Louvre .
In the last years , it 's a <unk> feminist feminist .
In the 1950s , <unk> of 2014 , in MTV , <unk> in front of the word `` feminist .
It was a great show , to see this star of the pop pop star and to do to know women and young men who will be a feminist thing to be proud .
We 're going to get the time , the technological critics started <unk> , whether it was not just feminist .
You know , you know , they 're just going to think about the word of a adult , adult women .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're still fighting for a lot , we want a lot , we need a lot , we need a lot .
We 're going to go much more beyond critical critical and constructive , for the feminism of any woman , spinning until it 's not going .
We do n't need to do that .
It 's wrong , or more well , a more inclusive feminism is the point of starting .
But what happens after ?
We 're going to recognize our flaws to give them , go to the action and be a little more brave .
If I hear music , I 'm making a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide an unlimited supply .
These artists would not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they 're going to be able to make the change affecting their profits .
No question is difficult .
Why has your music to be as <unk> ?
It 's hard to pick something better and so easy to justify a worst choice .
But when the bad decisions are required that it 's more difficult for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility .
I think , in my nieces , three and four years .
It 's two great girls and brilliant girls , and also very brave .
And where you 're going to tell you for the strong creatures that are .
I think , all of a sudden , the best choice is a lot more easy to do .
We all can take better decisions .
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sports , <unk> <unk> .
We can change the radio radio when we hear songs that treat women as anything .
We can spend our money to go to the movies in another part when the films do n't treat women more than cameras .
We can be able to stop support sports , where athletes are trying to get their classmates as well .
In any case , the men , especially the white men , people can say , `` No , I 'm not going to publish his journal , to participate in his project , or working with you , until it does n't give a enough amount of women , so to engage them like to make decisions .
I 'm not going to work with you until his publication , or their organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people . ''
Those of us who are <unk> , but invited me to participate in this kind of projects , we can also be driven until more as we 're willing to overcome the barriers to the jobs of decision jobs .
So we 're not <unk> <unk> . Without these efforts , without to adopt these positions , our achievements are going to mean very little .
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions come to the top , people in the power of directors and producers of film and music producers and music , CEOs , the people who can take great decisions , more brave , to create a durable change and significant change .
We can also be able to tell us with courage , you know , bad , bad , or anything .
The last line of my book `` <unk> <unk> , '' says , `` Would n't be a bad feminist , not to be at all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons , but I say , about everything , because I said my voice to me to me , and the feminism helped me <unk> .
There was a incident .
I call this incident to do on what happened .
A little bit of guys <unk> when it was very young , and I did n't know that kids can do this to a girl .
They treated me like nothing .
I started believing it was n't anything .
It 's going to get my voice , and after all I did n't get me to believe that I could say something that might matter .
But -- I was writing .
And I went back to <unk> .
I 'm going to tell me in a stronger version of myself .
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine , and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin .
I read the words of women who showed me that it was n't .
I learned to write like them , and then I learned to write like myself .
I found my voice again , and I started believing that my voice is more beyond what you can measure .
During the writing and of feminism , I also found that if it was a little brave , another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world is going to tell us that we 're .
In a hand , I have the power to do anything .
And on the other , I think I 'm just a woman .
I 'm a bad feminist , I 'm a good woman , I 'm trying to improve my way to think , what I 'm doing , and what I do , without leaving everything that makes me human .
I hope we all could do the same thing .
I hope we all could be a little brave , when you need to be a little bit brave .
Right after Christmas last year of last year , <unk> children in California had measles , or to be exposed to somebody who had been there .
The virus then went back to the border of Canada , transforming more than 100 children in <unk> .
One of the tragic things of this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child , with an immune immune system , it 's one of the most easily diseases in the world .
There is a effective vaccine against this from a half century , but many of the kids involved in the outbreak , they had n't been killed because their parents had fear of something supposedly worse : autism .
But a moment , it was n't the paper that 's sequenced about autism and <unk> vaccines , waiting and <unk> by being a poetic fraud for the British Medical Center ?
Do n't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk> ?
I think most of you know it , but millions of parents around the world are still going to get vaccines to make their children to have autism .
Why ?
Here 's why .
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time .
For most of the 20th century , autism was considered a very rare disease .
The few psychologists and hoping that I 'd heard about she create all his professional life without seeing a single case .
For decades , the estimates of prevalence kept stable as only three or four children for every 10,000 .
But then , in the 1990s , the numbers started <unk> .
<unk> of funds as <unk> <unk> is <unk> by autism as an epidemic , as if it could be a lot of another child in the middle .
What 's going on ?
If you 're not the vaccines , what is it ?
If you ask people to the <unk> of the limits of <unk> of Atlanta , what 's going on , tend to be based on phrases like `` criteria of diagnosis , '' and `` <unk> of cases , '' to explain these growing numbers .
But that kind of language does n't make a lot of the fears of a young mother , which is looking for the face of his six-year-old son , the visual contact .
If the criteria of the diagnosis had to be in , why were they <unk> at the beginning ?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the 1990s ?
Five years ago , I decided to discover the answers to these questions .
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow , and I have a little bit of the science that with the understanding of storytelling .
For the most part of the 20th century , the doctors told a story about what autism is , and how it was discovered , but that story turned out to be fake , and the consequences of the same are having an devastating impact in the global public health health .
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinic .
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we have to go .
The first story starts with a child film , Leo <unk> , at Johns Johns Hopkins . In Calcutta , <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked at private worlds , <unk> people around their own , even their own parents .
You could have fun for hours by putting the hands on the hands to their faces , but they were known to <unk> as when they did n't put his favorite toy in its usual place without knowing them .
The base of the patients treated in their clinic , <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare .
By the 1950s , as a major authority of the world in the issue , he was declared that I had seen less than 150 cases of his syndrome as a <unk> of places like South Africa .
This is actually not no wonder , because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk> .
For example , I 'm going to give that diagnosis to children with seizures , but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism .
Once he had been <unk> that he had become nine children sent by other doctors to his office to be <unk> without giving them a diagnosis of autism .
It was a smart man , but part of their theories were not <unk> .
It <unk> autism as a form of young child , because of the cold , <unk> parents .
These kids , he said , they 've kept a little bit carefully in a refrigerator .
At the same time , I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they put into certain areas like music , mathematics and memory .
One of the children in your clinic could distinguish between 18 to the two years before I would get two years .
When his mother put one of his favorites , he properly said , `` Beethoven . ''
But it was <unk> had a bad view of these skills , they 're going to say things like the children were just told by what they had heard their parents <unk> , because by winning their denominator .
As a result , autism became a source of shame for families , and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good , becomes invisible to the world in general .
It was not until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird .
<unk> <unk> , an cognitive psychologist of London , I thought that the theory of the mothers 's theory of <unk> were pretty stupid .
She and her husband was warm and <unk> , and they had a profound child named Susie .
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child , like Susie without a support , without special education , and without access to other resources without a diagnosis .
To talk to the U.S. Service , they needed more resources for the regular children and their families , <unk> and his colleague Stanley Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before .
So they 've got a study of autism in the general population .
So we took a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the <unk> kids in the community .
So , what you saw is that the <unk> model was too limited , because the reality of autism was much more small and diverse .
Some kids could n't speak at all , whereas others were <unk> in its fascination for the logo , in the dinosaurs , or in the genealogy of <unk> .
In the other way , these kids did n't fit into <unk> and <unk> , as 1938 , and you saw a lot of them , much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted .
At principle , they were lost by trying to make meaning .
How did n't you have to tell these children before ?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in Sacramento , the next year to the article of <unk> , and then I forgot , buried under a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember .
I knew I knew about this paper paper , but I 'm going to stop <unk> .
There was n't even a translation in English , but luckily , the husband of <unk> German talked , and he translated it for her .
The document offers an alternative history of autism .
His author was a man named Hans Asperger 's called Hans syndrome , which was a <unk> clinic in Vienna in the 1930s .
The ideas of Asperger 's ideas for teaching children with differences of learning were <unk> even for contemporary standards .
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises , and kids were getting their games on the afternoon .
Instead of blame the parents of doing autism , Chris described it as severe <unk> of their support , <unk> forms of support and displaced spaces over the course of life .
Instead of trying to treat children in their clinic as patients , named he called their small teachers , and he went to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them .
In addition , Chris saw autism as a diverse continuum that they have a staggering variety of portable and disability .
He believed that autism and <unk> traits were common and always have been , looking at this continuum of this continuum in <unk> culture as the awkward social scientist and the professor .
He was more there even to say , that for success in science and art , a piece of autism is essential .
<unk> and Lima found that I was wrong in that autism was <unk> , so the parents were the user .
In the next years , they worked in silence with the American American Association to expand the diversity of what they called `` spectrum spectrum . ''
In the end of the '80s and the early '90s , their changes came into place , a limited model of <unk> for a broad and <unk> of Asperger .
And these changes did n't fall on .
You know , when you 're going to say , when we 're going to <unk> and analysts worked between us to reform these criteria , people around the world to see an average adult for the first time .
Before he came out , `` Rain Man '' in 1988 , just a small circle , <unk> by experts knew what autism was , but after the performance performance , but after the performance performance of <unk> , and the recognition of `` Iron Man . ''
At the same time , the first time , the first time , the first time , the first clinical trials of using autism .
I did n't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son .
The combination of <unk> Man , the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a single storm of the awareness of autism .
The number of diagnostics started to rise , the same thing that they predicted <unk> and strictly , in fact , they were hoping that the people with autism and their families finally support the support and the services that they were involved .
So Andrew <unk> came to the vaccines for the rise of the rise , a simple , powerful story , and I experienced a bad story like the <unk> theory that autism was <unk> .
If the current estimate of the center of the center of now that one of eight children in the United States are right , the <unk> are one of the biggest world in the world .
In the last few years , people have been together on the Internet to reject the idea that they 're puzzles by solving for the new medical breakthroughs , <unk> the term `` <unk> '' to celebrate the varieties of human cognition .
A way to understand the <unk> is to think about human systems systems .
The fact that a PC does n't work with Windows , does n't mean it 's broken .
According to <unk> standards , the normal human brain is easily <unk> , and it 's a <unk> of attention to the details .
No doubt , people have difficulties to live in a world not built for them .
70 years later , we 're still getting a <unk> , which creates that the cure for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers , employers with capacity , support communities , and the parents with faith in the potential of their children .
A great woman named <unk> <unk> once said , `` We need all the hands in deck to <unk> the boat of mankind . ''
While we compare to a uncertain future , we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to make the challenges that we face as a society .
We ca n't afford to be able to afford to eat no brain .
Thank you .
